# Search Functionality Test Report
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Test Framework:** Playwright
**Application:** MQ Studio (http://localhost:3100)

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive Playwright test suite was created and executed to test the search functionality of the MQ Studio website. The tests revealed **critical issues** with the application server preventing proper evaluation of search features.

### Test Results Overview
- **Total Tests:** 11
- **Passed:** 2 (18%)
- **Failed:** 9 (82%)
- **Test Duration:** 5.6 minutes

## Critical Finding: Server Error

**PRIMARY ISSUE:** The application is returning HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) for most page loads, preventing proper testing of search functionality.

All screenshots captured show:
```
Internal Server Error
```

This server error prevented:
- Loading the homepage
- Accessing search functionality
- Viewing search results
- Testing any search features

## Test Coverage Attempted

### 1. ✗ Homepage Search Bar Visibility
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Issue:** Page timeout - server returned error
- **Expected:** Search input field visible on homepage
- **Actual:** Could not load homepage due to server error

### 2. ✗ Autocomplete Suggestions
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Issue:** Search input element not found
- **Expected:** Typing "landscape" slowly should show autocomplete suggestions
- **Actual:** Page did not load, no search field available

### 3. ✗ Search Navigation with "landscape"
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Issue:** Test timeout while attempting to fill search field
- **Expected:** Navigate to /search page with query parameter
- **Actual:** Could not interact with search field

### 4. ✗ Results Grouped by Type
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Issue:** No content type groups found (Publications, Artworks, Musings, Projects)
- **Expected:** Results grouped by content type with headers
- **Actual:** Found 0 content type groups
- **Note:** This test reached the search results page but found no grouping structure

### 5. ✓ Result Card Structure
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Issue:** None (but with warning)
- **Warning:** "No results found - may indicate search functionality issue"
- **Note:** Test passed because it handled the "no results" case gracefully

### 6. ✗ Search for "watercolor"
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Issue:** Test timeout while clearing search field
- **Expected:** Display results relevant to "watercolor"
- **Actual:** Could not interact with search input

### 7. ✗ Empty Search Handling
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Issue:** Test timeout while clearing search field
- **Expected:** Graceful handling (stay on homepage, show message, or show all results)
- **Actual:** Could not test due to interaction timeout

### 8. ✗ Special Characters in Search
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Issue:** Test timeout on first special character query (@#$%)
- **Expected:** No crashes with special characters: @#$%, test & design, quote"test, apostrophe's test, slash/test
- **Actual:** Could not complete any special character tests

### 9. ✗ Very Long Query
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Issue:** Test timeout while filling 500-character query
- **Expected:** Graceful handling of very long search queries
- **Actual:** Could not test due to interaction timeout

### 10. ✗ Search Results Relevance
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Issue:** Search results do not contain query term "landscape"
- **Expected:** Results page should show "landscape" in content or query display
- **Actual:** `isRelevant = false` - query term not found in page content

### 11. ✓ Test Summary Generation
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Note:** Summary test always passes as it just logs test coverage

## Issues Identified

### Critical Issues (Blockers)

1. **Server 500 Error**
   - **Severity:** CRITICAL
   - **Impact:** Prevents all testing
   - **Description:** Application returns "Internal Server Error" on page loads
   - **Action Required:** Debug and fix server-side error before search functionality can be tested
   - **Location:** http://localhost:3100

2. **Search Input Not Accessible**
   - **Severity:** CRITICAL
   - **Impact:** Cannot test search functionality
   - **Description:** When page does load, search input field is not found using standard selectors:
     - `input[type="search"]`
     - `input[placeholder*="Search"]`
     - `input[name="search"]`
   - **Possible Causes:**
     - Search input uses non-standard attributes
     - Search is implemented as a different element type
     - Search is loaded dynamically and not present on initial render
   - **Action Required:** Investigate actual HTML structure of search implementation

### High Priority Issues

3. **No Content Grouping Found**
   - **Severity:** HIGH
   - **Description:** Search results page does not have expected grouping by content type
   - **Expected:** Sections for Publications, Artworks, Musings, Projects
   - **Action Required:** Implement or fix result grouping feature

4. **Search Results Not Relevant**
   - **Severity:** HIGH
   - **Description:** Search results page does not contain the search query term
   - **Impact:** Users cannot verify their search was processed
   - **Action Required:** Ensure query term is displayed somewhere on results page

### Medium Priority Issues

5. **Test Timeouts**
   - **Severity:** MEDIUM
   - **Description:** Multiple tests timeout at 30 seconds
   - **Possible Causes:**
     - Server performance issues
     - Network latency
     - Application hanging during load
   - **Action Required:** Investigate server performance

## Screenshots Captured

All test screenshots are available in:
```
/home/ichardart/code/clients/moura_quayle/website-mq-studio/test-results/
```

Sample screenshots captured:
- Homepage error state (Internal Server Error)
- Failed search interactions
- Timeout states

**Note:** Due to server errors, meaningful search functionality screenshots could not be captured.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Server Error**
   - Priority: CRITICAL
   - Action: Debug the Next.js application to identify why it's returning 500 errors
   - Check server logs for error messages
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Check for missing environment variables or configuration

2. **Verify Search Implementation**
   - Priority: CRITICAL
   - Action: Once server is fixed, manually verify search functionality exists
   - Document actual HTML structure of search input
   - Update test selectors if needed

3. **Implement Search Features**
   - Priority: HIGH
   - Required features based on test expectations:
     - Search input field on homepage
     - Search results page at /search or with query parameters
     - Result grouping by content type
     - Display of search query on results page
     - Autocomplete suggestions (optional but tested)

### Testing Process Improvements

1. **Pre-Test Server Health Check**
   - Add automated check for server health before running tests
   - Verify application returns 200 OK for homepage
   - Fail fast if server is not responding correctly

2. **Increase Timeout for Development**
   - Current timeout: 30 seconds
   - Recommendation: Increase to 60 seconds during development
   - Restore to 30 seconds for CI/CD

3. **Better Error Reporting**
   - Capture server console output during tests
   - Log network errors to separate file
   - Screenshot on every navigation, not just failures

- Console Output: See test execution log above

## Next Steps

1. **Debug Server** - Resolve Internal Server Error (500)
2. **Verify Search Exists** - Manually test that search functionality is implemented
3. **Update Tests** - Adjust selectors based on actual HTML structure
4. **Re-run Tests** - Execute test suite again after fixes
5. **Implement Missing Features** - Add any search features that don't exist yet

## Conclusion

While a comprehensive test suite was successfully created covering all requested scenarios (autocomplete, result grouping, multiple queries, edge cases, screenshots), **the tests could not meaningfully evaluate search functionality due to a critical server error**.

The application must be debugged and stabilized before search functionality can be properly tested. Once the server is operational, this test suite will provide thorough coverage of:
- Search bar visibility and interaction
- Autocomplete behavior
- Search result navigation
- Result grouping and structure
- Multiple search queries
- Edge case handling (empty search, special characters, long queries)
- Result relevance
