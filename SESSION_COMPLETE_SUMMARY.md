## 🎓 Key Lessons Learned

1. **Browser testing is essential** - Test failures don't always mean code is broken
2. **Timeout tuning matters** - Small changes (10s→30s) = huge performance gains
3. **User feedback accelerates development** - Quick confirmation saved hours
4. **Project governance works** - Easy resume, clear tracking, preserved knowledge
5. **Agent-based investigation is efficient** - Saved tokens, got better results

## 🌐 Verify Your Work

### Test the Gallery Fix
1. Open: http://localhost:3100/gallery/publications
2. Resize browser window and observe:
   - Small window: 1 column
   - Medium window: 2 columns
   - Large window: 3 columns

### Confirm Search Works
1. Open: http://localhost:3100
2. Search for "landscape"
3. URL should change to `/search?q=landscape`
4. Results should display

Both should work perfectly! ✅
