Strategic Foundation
This document outlines the core strategic decisions that form the foundation for the Moura Quayle website project.
Client Insights: Moura Quayle
Core Concept: Moura’s "Why"
Moura values people, relationships, and connection. Her purpose is not to build a static library; it is to build a working studio of curated “experiences, experiments, rough drafts and finished works" where she can welcome people she knows or meets and share with them something of the many sides to her: designer, creator, scholar, leader, teacher, student, presenter, traveler, adventurer, etc. This platform must feel active, current, and forward-looking. It must invite, welcome, and engage in a way that deepens relationships and connection. 
NOTE: Moura is not selling anything, doesn’t need people to buy or buy-into anything. The website isn’t about that.
Core Concept: Moura’s personal brand is the Integrated "Whole Person." 
Moura is a holistic thinker whose strategic mind is informed by an artist's eye, and whose creative work is enriched by a deep understanding of leadership and design. It will not present "Moura the Professor" and "Moura the Artist", “Moura, Dave Fushtey’s Life Partner”, etc. in separate silos. 
Core Concept: 🎯 “The MQ Framework”, a Three-Fold Practice
Moura doesn't just "bridge" different worlds—she operates simultaneously in three states of the MQ Framework:
1. THINKING (Head) – Reflecting, contemplating and scholarly, rigorous conceptualizing
2. FEELING (Heart) – Appreciative experiencing of affects, emotions, and aesthetics
3. DOING (Hand) – Outward activity, action, motion, physicality, production
This isn't about switching between modes—it's about their constant interplay. The website should reflect this triadic nature.
Core Concept: 🌀 “Experiences, Experiments, Rough Drafts & Finished Works”
Moura views her life as a work in progress – a constant unfolding of experiences, with her now (the present) always shaped both by her appreciation for what has been, what has happened (the past) and the liminal space of possibility, novelty, potential, the unknown (the future). She enthusiastically embraces play and learning in all areas of her life through experimentation; she is unafraid to “get her hands dirty” in working with rough drafts that may or may not ever go anywhere; and, she has the focus, tenacity and discipline to generate polished, well-designed and well-crafted finished products when there is value in that. 
Moura’s generation and sharing of Experiences, Experiments and Rough Drafts is reflective of the fact that she does not aim for perfection, does not purport perfection, does not assume anything can or will be perfect, does not wait for perfection. She’s always moving, manifesting, embodying and instantiating. There’s beauty in what is, whatever it is – something that touches on the Japanese notion of wabi sabi. 
But there’s also beauty in design – intentional acts of functional, utilitarian elegance based an assessments of what “fits” a specific time, a specific context. Moura is not interested in teleology or orthodoxy -- some abstract notion of “rightness” or “correctness”. 
Core Concept: the “MQ Studio”
Moura's website is MQ Studio, a space where she “builds in public” by sharing her experiences, rough drafts and finished works:
• Academic papers live next to watercolors
• Governance theory meets brush practice
• David's systematic thinking dances with Moura's fluid expression
• Visitors don't just consume content—they witness process
Visitor Insights: "The Curious Practitioner"
The people who come to Moura’s website will be people who know her, who know of her, or whom she meets. They are not finding her through SEO, but rather have encountered or heard about her in some context of her life – academia, travel, art, etc.
Primary Persona
This persona represents the primary audience for the website.
• Persona: Dr. Alisha Sharma
• Role: Mid-career academic and practitioner in public policy.
• Scenario: She knows of Moura Quayle's work at UBC but is not deeply familiar with its breadth or its connection to David Fushtey's work on governance.
Jobs to be Done (Goals)
• Functional: Find specific publications, verify biographical details for citations, and access downloadable resources (PDFs, links).
• Social: Appear knowledgeable, discover credible new thinkers, and share concepts with colleagues and students.
• Emotional: Feel inspired by a new way of thinking, satisfy intellectual curiosity, and feel a connection to the person behind the work.
Pains (Frustrations)
• Wasting time on confusing university profiles or abandoned websites.
• Encountering broken links or paywalls.
• Navigating sites that are purely self-promotional with no real substance.
• Finding information that feels dated and disconnected from current conversations.
Gains (Hopes & Desires)
• Finding a central, trustworthy, and beautifully organized repository.
• Discovering unexpected connections between ideas (e.g., art and leadership).
• Easy, one-click access to high-quality content.
• Getting a sense of the person behind the CV—their motivations and current thoughts.
• Leaving the site feeling more knowledgeable and inspired.
Value Proposition Canvas
This canvas details how the website's features create value for our visitor persona, "The Curious Practitioner."
Key Insight: our goal is to engage them on an emotional and intellectual level, not just a functional one. We are not just helping them find a paper; we are helping them "discover their own connections" with Moura, with her thoughts, feelings and “doings”
Gain Creators (How We Create Value)
• The "MQ Studio" concept, featuring "Moura's Musings," demonstrates that Moura’s life is an active, evolving project, creating a sense of connection and current relevance.
• The "Whole Person" narrative explicitly draws connections between art, leadership, and legacy, satisfying curiosity and sparking inspiration.
• A thematically curated Studio allows for serendipitous discovery of related material beyond a simple author or keyword search.
Pain Relievers (How We Alleviate Frustrations)
• A clean, powerful search and filtering system will eliminate frustrating searches.
• Providing direct PDF downloads or clear links to open-access versions wherever possible will bypass paywalls and broken links.
• The site's purpose as a non-commercial "MQ Studio" removes the feeling of being marketed to and ensures a focus on substance.
• Meticulous content curation will ensure all links are functional and information is trustworthy.
Products & Services (The Website's Features)
• The Publications Archive: A single, filterable repository for Moura's and David's published written works.
• The Artworks Gallery: To be structured with two distinct sub-sections to properly feature both Watercolour & Painting and Shufa (Calligraphy).
• Moura's Musings: A section for ongoing reflections, designed to accommodate recordings ("musings out loud") as well as text.
• Narrative "About" Section: A dedicated space to tell the integrated stories of Moura and David.
Aesthetic Design System
Ultimate Vision
This isn't a website—it's a living workspace where visitors can:
• Experience Moura thinking, feeling and doing
• See ideas form
• Discover their own connections
• Contribute to the conversation
• Leave changed
The site should feel like spending an afternoon in Moura's actual studio-study, where a governance paper might be drying next to a watercolor, where David's books share shelves with art supplies, and where every visit reveals new conversations between different ways of knowing.
The tagline: "Welcome to MQ Studio, where I share Experiences, Experiments, Rough Drafts and Finished Works."
This is more ambitious than a portfolio, more humble than an archive, more alive than a blog. It's Moura's actual manifesting, embodying and practice made visible and shareable.
💭 Moura’s Voice: "Wondering Together"
The new voice should be:
• Invitational: "I've been wondering about..."
• Exploratory: "What if we consider..."
• Grateful: "Thanks to a conversation with..."
• Uncertain: "I'm not sure yet, but..."
• Connective: "This reminds me of what David used to say..."
🌸 David's Presence
Although he passed away some years ago after decades of marriage, Moura’s life-partner Dave was and remains a presence in Moura’s Thinking, Feeling and Doing – her heart, head, and practice. His legacy is woven in as a foundational element of Moura’s integrated worldview, with his voice curated and championed by Moura. 
David therefore isn't a separate section in Moura’s website. Instead:
• His quotes appear as marginalia
• His governance principles annotate current work
• "Conversations with David" as a recurring series
• His systematic approach contrasts with Moura's fluidity
Visual Inspiration: “Moura as Palette'
A devoted appreciator of fashion and textiles, Moura literally wears her art. The website should feel like a space that reflects Moura’s heart:
• Lived-in - Not pristine gallery walls but a working studio
• Layered - Years of thought and practice visible in the textures
• Warm - Like her smile in those photos
• Active - Paint still wet, thoughts still forming
To generate the working studio feel:  
• Use the ACTUAL colors from her jackets/scarves as primary accents
• Let her paintings provide seasonal color variations
• The shufa seal red as the constant anchor
• Paper textures from actual watercolor paper

Additional Guidance for AI Design
Use Montserrat font for all headings, titles, and navigation elements. Use Lora font for all body text, paragraphs, and content areas. Apply font-weight: 500 for Montserrat headings and font-weight: 400 for Lora body text. Maintain consistent spacing with padding multiples of 0.5rem. Use subtle transitions (200ms ease) on all interactive elements. Apply warm Scholar Blue shadows instead of black shadows. Use 20% opacity Moura Teal for text selection backgrounds. Ensure cards have subtle elevation with warm shadow tones. Buttons should have slightly rounded corners (0.5rem radius). Primary buttons use Moura Teal with Rice Paper text. Secondary buttons use Scholar Blue with Rice Paper text. Accent elements use Sage Wisdom for subtle highlights. Apply Studio Cream background to special feature sections. Use Shufa Red sparingly only for signature moments or authentication marks. Maintain 60% Rice Paper, 20% Moura Teal, 10% accent colors proportion. Group interface elements by thinking (teal/blue), feeling (pink/violet), and doing (yellow/sage) modes. Ensure minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for all text. Use consistent 8px spacing grid system. Apply gentle hover states with 10% lightening on interactive elements.
✨ The Magic: Seasonal Rhythms
The site subtly changes with seasons:
• Spring: Watercolor washes appear
• Summer: Brighter accents from paintings
• Fall: Calligraphy becomes prominent
• Winter: More text, deeper reflections
Imagery & Texture
• Photography: Authentic, natural-light portraits of Moura that feel thoughtful and engaging.
• Artwork: High-resolution scans of her watercolour paintings and shufa will be used as key visual elements throughout the site.
• Texture: A subtle, near-imperceptible texture of cold-press watercolour paper will be used on the background to add depth and tactile warmth.

Content
📝 Content Philosophy: "Thinking Out Loud"
Stop presenting finished thoughts. Instead:
• Show work in progress
• Include questions without answers
• Let contradictions exist
• Feature failed experiments alongside successes
• Date everything to show evolution of thinking
🔄 The Resonance Engine (Reimagined)
Not just an AI connection-finder but three types of resonance:
1. Conceptual Resonance - Ideas that speak to each other
2. Temporal Resonance - How thoughts evolved over time
3. Material Resonance - How a brushstroke relates to a theory
Example: A governance paper from 2010 resonates with:
• A watercolor from 2015 (same organic systems thinking)
• David's notes from 2008 (foundational conversation)
• A recent musing about emergence
