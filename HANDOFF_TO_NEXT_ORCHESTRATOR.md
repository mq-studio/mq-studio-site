## üéØ What Next Orchestrator Should Do

### Option 1: Finish Test Optimization (Recommended, ~30min)
**Why:** Get to 90%+ test pass rate

**Tasks:**
1. Re-run tests to verify gallery fixes pass
2. Adjust search navigation tests (use `page.waitForURL()`)
3. Investigate remaining 3 timeout tests (may need 45-60s timeout)

**Expected Outcome:** ~90% test pass rate

---

### Option 2: Add Content Validation (~45min)
**Why:** Prevent future YAML parsing errors

**Tasks:**
1. Install `yaml-lint` package
2. Create validation script in package.json
3. Add to pre-commit hook
4. Test on existing content

**Expected Outcome:** Automated protection against content errors

---

### Option 3: Complete Musings Integration (RECOMMENDED for blog import)
**Why:** Integrate the 76 imported archive posts with current Musings

**Tasks:**
1. Download media assets: `cd migration-tools && source venv/bin/activate && python download-media.py`
2. Integrate archive posts with current musings in `/app/musings/page.tsx`
3. Implement `LegacyMusingBadge` component in musing display
4. Test search functionality includes archive content
5. Ensure mobile responsiveness for archive posts

**Expected Outcome:** Fully integrated "living archive" with 8 years of content

---

### Option 4: Start New Feature Development
**Why:** Application is stable enough for new features

**Prerequisites:**
- Read `docs/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md` for governance
- Check `docs/ISSUES_TRACKER.md` for known issues
- Review `docs/SESSION_HISTORY.md` for context
- Review `docs/SPECIFICATIONS/` for feature specs
