# MQ Studio - Next Steps & Priorities

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-26 (After test timeout fixes)
**Current Status:** Application functional, 81% tests passing, test suite 59% faster

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Actions (Next 1-2 hours)

### Priority 1: Verify Search Functionality in Real Browser
**Why:** Tests show navigation not working, but code is correct. Need to verify actual user experience.

**Steps:**
1. Open http://localhost:3100 in your browser
2. Type "landscape" in the search bar
3. Click "Search" button or press Enter
4. **Expected:** URL should change to `/search?q=landscape`
5. **If it works:** Update ISSUES_TRACKER.md - issue is test-only, not real bug
6. **If it doesn't work:** Debug SearchBar component

**Time:** 5-10 minutes
**Decision Point:** This determines if we fix tests or fix code

---

### Priority 2: Address Remaining Test Issues
**Why:** 7 tests still failing, but for different reasons than before

**Choose based on Priority 1 results:**

#### If Search Works in Browser:
Focus on test infrastructure improvements
- Increase test timeout to 45-60s for remaining flaky tests
- Add retry logic for screenshot operations
- Mark navigation tests as "known test framework limitation"

#### If Search Doesn't Work in Browser:
Focus on code fixes
- Debug SearchBar router.push() navigation
- Check Next.js router configuration
- Verify search page exists and handles query params

**Time:** 30-60 minutes

---

### Priority 3: Fix Gallery Layout (Quick Win)
**Why:** CSS-only fix, visible improvement, easy to verify

**Issue:** Desktop gallery shows 1 column instead of 3+

**Steps:**
1. Open http://localhost:3100/gallery/publications in browser
2. Open browser dev tools
3. Inspect gallery grid container
4. Check computed styles for `grid-template-columns`
5. Update CSS media queries for desktop breakpoints

**Expected Fix:**
```css
@media (min-width: 1280px) {
  .gallery-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  }
}
```

**Time:** 15-30 minutes
**Impact:** Fixes 2 test failures immediately

---

## ðŸ”„ Secondary Actions (Next session or later today)

### Priority 4: Document Today's Work
**Why:** Preserve lessons learned for future sessions

**Steps:**
1. Update `docs/SESSION_HISTORY.md` with complete session summary
2. Update `docs/ISSUES_TRACKER.md` with resolved issues
3. Update `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_DECISIONS_LOG.md` with timeout decision
4. Archive any temporary files

**Time:** 15-20 minutes
**Tool:** Already have templates in place

---

### Priority 5: Add Content Validation (Prevent Future YAML Errors)
**Why:** Prevent production failures like the YAML parsing error

**Steps:**
1. Install `yaml-lint` package: `npm install --save-dev yaml-lint`
2. Create validation script in `package.json`
3. Add to pre-commit hook or CI/CD
4. Test on existing content files

**Time:** 30-45 minutes
**Impact:** Prevents critical site-wide failures

---

### Priority 6: Fix React Event Handler Warning
**Why:** Clean console logs, best practices

**Issue:** NotFound component has onClick handler issue

**Steps:**
1. Find `app/not-found.tsx`
2. Add `'use client'` directive, OR
3. Extract button to separate client component

**Time:** 10-15 minutes
**Impact:** Cleaner dev experience, no functional change

## ðŸŽ“ Lessons from This Session

1. **Timeout fixes had massive impact** - 59% faster tests, 40% fewer timeout failures
2. **Search code is correct** - Need browser verification to distinguish test issues from real bugs
3. **Project governance system works** - Easy to resume, track issues, document decisions
4. **Agent-based investigation is efficient** - Saved tokens, got comprehensive results

---

## ðŸ’¡ My Recommendation

**Start with Option A (User Experience Focus)** because:

1. **5-minute browser test** answers the biggest question (is search broken?)
2. **Gallery layout fix** gives immediate visible improvement
3. **Documentation** preserves today's excellent progress
4. **Leaves test issues** for when you have more time or energy

After that, you'll have:
- âœ… Working application
- âœ… Clear picture of real vs test-only issues
- âœ… Visual improvements
- âœ… Complete documentation

Then decide if you want to continue with testing or take a break.

## ðŸ“ž Questions to Answer First

Before proceeding, please test in your browser:

**Test 1: Search Navigation**
1. Go to http://localhost:3100
2. Type "landscape" in search bar
3. Click Search button
4. **Does URL change to `/search?q=landscape`?** (Yes/No)

**Test 2: Gallery Layout**
1. Go to http://localhost:3100/gallery/publications
2. Resize browser to full width
3. **How many columns do you see?** (1, 2, or 3+)

**Your answers will determine the exact next steps!**

---

## ðŸš€ Want to Continue Now?

If you want me to continue immediately, just say:
- **"Fix gallery layout"** - I'll tackle the CSS issue
- **"Test search myself first"** - I'll wait while you verify in browser
- **"Document everything"** - I'll update all session docs
- **"Continue with Option A/B/C"** - I'll follow that plan

Otherwise, everything is documented and ready for next session!
