          <p>
            Moura Quayle is a landscape architect, academic, and artist whose work spans
            governance, design, and creative expression. Her career has been defined by a
            commitment to interdisciplinary thinking and collaborative practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a Professor Emerita at the University of British Columbia School of Architecture
            and Landscape Architecture, Moura has contributed extensively to scholarship in
            landscape governance, community design, and urban planning. Her research explores
            the intersections of policy, place, and people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond academia, Moura is an accomplished watercolor artist and calligrapher.
            Her visual work reflects the same attention to detail and emotional depth that
            characterizes her scholarly pursuits—a testament to the philosophy that thinking,
            feeling, and doing are inseparable.
