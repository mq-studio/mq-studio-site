# MQ Studio - Broken Images Fixed

**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Issue:** Images not displaying in Art Gallery
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

## Problem Identified

The gallery was showing broken images for artworks like:
- "a la August"
- "Autumn Leaves Study No. 7"
- And 53 other artworks

**Root Cause:** Field name mismatch in frontmatter
- Gallery component expects: `imageUrl`
- 55 files were using: `image`

## Solution Applied

### Fixed 55 artwork files
Changed frontmatter field from `image:` to `imageUrl:`

**Example fix:**
```yaml
# Before (broken)
image: "/images/artworks/a-la-august.jpeg"

# After (working)
imageUrl: "/images/artworks/a-la-august.jpeg"
```
