# Daily Sync Meeting Structure

## Overview
15-minute daily synchronization between Design and Implementation tracks to ensure alignment and rapid decision-making.

## Meeting Schedule
- **Time**: Start of each workday (adjust to team timezone)
- **Duration**: 15 minutes maximum
- **Format**: Stand-up style
- **Participants**: Design lead, Implementation lead, + any blockers

## Meeting Agenda (15 minutes)

### 1. Design Track Update (5 minutes)
- What was completed yesterday
- What's planned for today
- Any blockers or decisions needed
- Handoff items ready

### 2. Implementation Track Update (5 minutes)
- What was completed yesterday
- What's planned for today
- Any clarifications needed
- Technical constraints discovered

### 3. Cross-Track Alignment (5 minutes)
- Dependencies identified
- Decisions required
- Risk flagging
- Success celebrations

## Standing Questions

### For Design Track
1. Are we maintaining the design vision?
2. What user needs are we addressing today?
3. Any performance concerns with designs?
4. What's ready for developer handoff?

### For Implementation Track
1. Are we on track with timeline?
2. Any technical constraints for design?
3. What clarifications do we need?
4. Any efficiency opportunities spotted?

## Communication Protocols

### During Meeting
- Be specific and actionable
- Flag risks immediately
- Celebrate wins
- Park detailed discussions

### Between Meetings
- Use async communication for details
- Document decisions in project docs
- Update shared boards/trackers
- Emergency escalation allowed

## Decision Framework

### Can Decide in Meeting
- Visual direction clarifications
- Priority adjustments
- Resource allocation
- Timeline shifts

### Requires Separate Discussion
- Major scope changes
- Technical architecture decisions
- Budget impacts
- Stakeholder approvals

## Tools & Artifacts

### Meeting Tools
- Video call (if remote)
- Shared screen for visuals
- Timer to keep on track
- Note-taking rotation

### Daily Artifacts
- Updated task board
- Completed items list
- Blocker log
- Decision record

## Success Metrics

### Meeting Effectiveness
- Starts on time: 100%
- Stays within 15 min: 90%+
- All tracks represented: 100%
- Actions captured: 100%

### Sync Outcomes
- Blockers resolved: <24 hours
- Handoffs smooth: 95%+
- Rework minimized: <5%
- Team satisfaction: >8/10

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Don't
- Turn into design review
- Solve complex problems
- Assign blame
- Skip for convenience
- Extend beyond 15 minutes

### Do
- Keep energy high
- Focus on coordination
- Support each other
- Flag issues early
- Celebrate progress

## Example Sync

**Design**: "Yesterday completed 3 homepage mockups, today refining selected concept and starting component library. Need confirmation on mobile navigation pattern."

**Implementation**: "Yesterday finished user journey mapping and API structure. Today setting up development environment. Can provide mobile nav constraints by noon."

**Alignment**: "Mobile nav is critical path. Design will prototype 2 options by 11am, Dev will review technical feasibility by noon. Decision by 1pm."

## Remote Sync Adaptations

### For Distributed Teams
- Use collaborative boards
- Record for absent members
- Rotate meeting times if needed
- Emphasize written updates
- Screen share liberally

### Async Options
- Slack/Teams standup bot
- Loom video updates
- Written daily digests
- Shared progress tracker

## Phase-Specific Focus

### Phase 0-1 (Discovery/Definition)
- Concept alignment
- User need validation
- Technical feasibility
- Scope refinement

### Phase 2-3 (Design/Architecture)
- Design system sync
- Component planning
- Performance budgets
- Integration points

### Phase 4-5 (Build/Deploy)
- Implementation accuracy
- QA coordination
- Launch preparation
- Issue resolution

## Escalation Path

### When to Escalate
- Blocked >24 hours
- Scope creep detected
- Timeline at risk
- Quality concerns

### Escalation Process
1. Flag in daily sync
2. Schedule focused session
3. Involve stakeholders if needed
4. Document resolution

## Continuous Improvement

### Weekly Retrospective
- What worked well?
- What was challenging?
- How can we improve?
- Any process adjustments?

### Monthly Review
- Sync meeting effectiveness
- Communication health
- Velocity trends
- Team satisfaction

**Remember**: The daily sync is about coordination, not perfection. Keep it light, focused, and action-oriented. The goal is alignment and momentum, not detailed problem-solving.
