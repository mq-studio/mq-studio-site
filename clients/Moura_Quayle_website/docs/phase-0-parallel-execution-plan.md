# Phase 0: Parallel Track Execution Plan

## Overview
Phase 0 begins the parallel execution model with Design Track running ahead to explore visual possibilities while Implementation Track conducts business analysis.

## Design Track: Design Discovery

### Objectives
- Generate 5-8 low-fidelity concept variations
- Create mood boards for key sections
- Test "living archive" visual metaphors
- Explore navigation patterns

### Key Deliverables
1. **Homepage Concepts** (3-4 variations)
   - Hero treatment options
   - Navigation approaches
   - Content preview methods
   - "Living" element ideas

2. **Archive Visualization** (2-3 approaches)
   - Grid vs. timeline vs. network
   - Filter/search integration
   - Visual density options
   - Academic/artistic balance

3. **Mood Boards**
   - Overall atmosphere
   - Archive section
   - Artwork galleries
   - Musings section

4. **Interaction Patterns**
   - Hover states
   - Transition concepts
   - Loading behaviors
   - Micro-interactions

### Success Criteria
- Minimum 5 distinct concepts
- Each explores different aspect of "Bright Academia"
- Clear rationale for each direction
- Ready for stakeholder review

## Implementation Track: Business Analysis

### Objectives
- Analyze target users deeply
- Map user journeys
- Define success metrics
- Identify technical requirements

### Key Deliverables
1. **User Persona Refinement**
   - Dr. Alisha Sharma (primary)
   - Secondary personas
   - Anti-personas

2. **User Journey Maps**
   - Research pathway
   - Discovery pathway
   - Return visitor pathway
   - Citation/download flow

3. **Feature Prioritization**
   - Must-have for MVP
   - Nice-to-have list
   - Future considerations
   - Technical dependencies

4. **Success Metrics**
   - Engagement metrics
   - Functionality metrics
   - Performance targets
   - User satisfaction KPIs

### Success Criteria
- Clear understanding of user needs
- Prioritized feature list
- Measurable success definition
- Alignment with design explorations

## Synchronization Points

### Daily Sync (15 min)
- Morning: Design shares concepts
- Implementation shares insights
- Identify dependencies
- Adjust if needed

### Mid-Phase Check
- Review alignment
- Share key findings
- Adjust direction if needed
- Prepare for Phase 1

### Phase Completion
- Design: Present concepts
- Implementation: Present analysis
- Joint decision on direction
- Document learnings

## Timeline

### Day 1-2 (Today/Tomorrow)
**Design Track**:
- Morning: Homepage concepts
- Afternoon: Archive approaches
- Evening: Initial mood boards

**Implementation Track**:
- Morning: User research synthesis
- Afternoon: Journey mapping
- Evening: Feature analysis

### Day 3
**Both Tracks**:
- Morning: Refinement based on sync
- Afternoon: Finalize deliverables
- Evening: Prepare handoff

## Risk Mitigation
- Over-designing: Keep concepts low-fidelity
- Under-researching: Use existing client research
- Misalignment: Daily syncs prevent divergence
- Scope creep: Strict MVP focus

## Tools & Resources
**Design Track**:
- Figma for concepts
- Pinterest for mood boards
- Client's existing brand guide
- Competitor screenshots

**Implementation Track**:
- Miro for journey maps
- Existing project control doc
- User interview insights
- Analytics (if available)

## Success Metrics for Phase 0
- Complete in 2-3 days (vs 5-6 traditional)
- 5+ concepts generated
- Clear user understanding
- Strong track alignment
- Ready for Phase 1
