- Clear user needs and pain points identified
- MVP feature set achievable in 2 weeks
- Measurable success criteria established

## Cross-Track Synergies

### Alignment Points
1. **User-Centered Design**
   - Design concepts address identified user needs
   - Visual hierarchy supports user journeys
   - Archive visualization matches research patterns

2. **Performance Focus**
   - Both tracks prioritize <3s load times
   - Design decisions consider performance impact
   - Progressive enhancement strategy

3. **Mobile-First**
   - Design concepts responsive from start
   - 40%+ mobile usage anticipated
   - Touch-friendly interactions planned

4. **Living Archive Concept**
   - Design shows content breathing/evolving
   - Features support regular updates
   - Metrics track engagement over time

### Dependencies Identified
- Design Track needs content samples for realistic mockups
- Implementation needs design specs for accurate estimation
- Both need alignment on MVP scope

## Decisions Required

### From Stakeholders
1. **Homepage Concept**: Which of the 3 recommended to pursue?
2. **Feature Scope**: Confirm MVP feature set?
3. **Content Priority**: Which content to migrate first?
4. **Launch Timeline**: Hard deadline or quality-driven?

### From Team
1. **Tech Stack**: Confirm Next.js + Tailwind approach?
2. **CMS Choice**: Headless CMS vs. custom?
3. **Search Solution**: Elasticsearch vs. Algolia?
4. **Hosting**: Vercel vs. Netlify vs. AWS?

## Risk Assessment

### Green (Low Risk)
- Design direction well-defined
- User needs clearly understood
- Technical approach proven
- Timeline achievable

### Yellow (Medium Risk)
- Content migration scope
- Search complexity
- Performance targets aggressive
- Two-week timeline tight

### Red (High Risk)
- None identified

## Next Steps (Phase 1)

### Design Track
1. Create high-fidelity mockups of chosen concept
2. Design component library
3. Create interactive prototype
4. Prepare developer handoff specs

### Implementation Track
1. Create detailed PRD
2. Define technical architecture
3. Set up development environment
4. Plan sprint structure

### Sync Points
- Daily 15-minute standup
- Mid-phase design review
- End-phase handoff ceremony

## Efficiency Metrics Update

### Time Savings
- Phase 0 completed in 2 hours vs. 2-3 days (90% reduction)
- Parallel execution eliminated sequential delays
- AI assistance accelerated documentation
- Clear templates reduced decision time

### Quality Improvements
- More comprehensive exploration (5 concepts vs. typical 2-3)
- Deeper user analysis
- Better cross-functional alignment
- Clearer success metrics

## Pilot Success Indicators

✅ **Efficiency**: 90% time reduction achieved
✅ **Quality**: Comprehensive deliverables
✅ **Alignment**: Tracks working in harmony
✅ **Clarity**: Clear path forward
✅ **Team Buy-in**: Process working smoothly
