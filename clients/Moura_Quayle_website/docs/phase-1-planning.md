## Synchronization Points

### Daily Sync Topics
1. Design decisions needing PM input
2. Technical constraints affecting design
3. Scope clarifications
4. Timeline adjustments

### Mid-Phase Checkpoint
- Design review with stakeholders
- PRD alignment check
- Technical feasibility confirmation
- Scope lock for MVP

### Phase Completion
- Design handoff package
- PRD approval
- Architecture sign-off
- Ready for Phase 2

## Success Criteria

### Design Track Success
- [ ] 3+ pages designed at high fidelity
- [ ] 20+ components defined
- [ ] Prototype demonstrates key flows
- [ ] Design system documented
- [ ] Stakeholder approval received

### Implementation Track Success
- [ ] PRD comprehensive and clear
- [ ] All MVP features defined
- [ ] Technical approach validated
- [ ] Sprints planned realistically
- [ ] Team aligned on approach

## Risk Mitigation

### Design Risks
- **Over-designing**: Stay focused on MVP
- **Inconsistency**: Regular system checks
- **Performance**: Consider throughout
- **Accessibility**: Test continuously

### Implementation Risks
- **Scope creep**: Strict MVP adherence
- **Technical debt**: Plan for quality
- **Timeline pressure**: Buffer included
- **Communication**: Daily syncs critical
