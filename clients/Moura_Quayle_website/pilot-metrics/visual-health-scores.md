# BMAD Visual Design Pilot - Visual Health Scores

## Project: Moura Quayle Living Archive Website
**Scoring Method**: Objective metrics + qualitative assessment

## Visual Health Metrics

### 1. Design Consistency Score
**Definition**: How well design elements follow established patterns
**Target**: >85%

**Baseline** (from existing brand):
- Color usage: 90% (Well-defined palette)
- Typography: 85% (Montserrat + Lora established)
- Spacing: 70% (Some variations noted)
- Component patterns: 60% (Room for improvement)
**Overall**: 76%

**Current Score**: [To be measured after implementation]

### 2. Accessibility Compliance
**Definition**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
**Target**: 100% AA compliant

**Areas to Track**:
- [ ] Color contrast ratios
- [ ] Keyboard navigation
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Focus indicators
- [ ] Alt text coverage

**Current Score**: [To be measured]

### 3. Performance Impact
**Definition**: Design decisions' effect on load time and rendering
**Target**: <3s initial load, <100ms interactions

**Metrics**:
- Asset optimization score
- CSS complexity
- Animation performance
- Render blocking resources

**Current Score**: [To be measured]

### 4. Brand Alignment
**Definition**: How well execution matches "Bright Academia" vision
**Target**: 9/10 stakeholder satisfaction

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Scholarly credibility ✓
- Artistic vibrancy ✓
- Personal uniqueness ✓
- Cool, bright colors ✓
- Multifaceted identity ✓

**Current Score**: [To be assessed with stakeholders]

### 5. Component Reusability
**Definition**: Percentage of UI built with reusable components
**Target**: >80%

**Tracking**:
- Unique components created
- Component variations
- One-off implementations
- Design token usage

**Current Score**: [To be measured during development]

## Visual Debt Tracking

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Legacy styles to refactor
- [ ] Inconsistent patterns to standardize
- [ ] Performance optimizations needed

### Design Debt
- [ ] Incomplete component variations
- [ ] Missing responsive behaviors
- [ ] Accessibility improvements needed

## Comparative Analysis

| Metric | Traditional Approach | BMAD Approach | Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Time to visual concept | 5 days | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| Design system maturity | Ad hoc | Systematic | [TBD] |
| Handoff clarity | 6/10 | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| Implementation accuracy | 70% | [TBD] | [TBD] |

## Visual Quality Checkpoints

### Phase -1 Checkpoint
- [ ] Brand principles defined
- [ ] Design tokens created
- [ ] Constraints documented
- [ ] Visual direction approved

### Phase 0 Checkpoint
- [ ] Mood boards created
- [ ] Concept variations (5-8)
- [ ] Stakeholder alignment
- [ ] Direction selected

### Phase 1 Checkpoint
- [ ] High-fidelity mockups
- [ ] Interactive prototypes

- [ ] Visual QA complete
- [ ] Performance validated

## Notes
- Existing "Bright Academia" system provides strong foundation
- Focus on systematic implementation vs. ad hoc
- Measure both efficiency AND quality improvements
