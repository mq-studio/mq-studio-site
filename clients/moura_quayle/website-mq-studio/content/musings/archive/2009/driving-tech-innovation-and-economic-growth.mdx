The cab driver test – you know how it goes.  You get in the cab and you ask them a burning question – like “what do you think about this whole climate change deal?”  And you get a response that is totally anecdotal but always interesting.  **Terry Tamminen** started this session with his own story which gave an example of both ends of the response spectrum.

The line-up for this plenary included:  Governor **Ted Kulongoski** from Oregon,  Governor **Jim Doyle** from Wisconsin, **Theodor Craver**, CEO of Edison International, **David Cush**, CEO of Virgin America, Premier **Danny Williams** from Nfld & Laborador, **Michael Rea** from the Carbon Trust in the UK, and, **Pablo Mandeville**, Uruguay Resident Coordinator for UN.

Noted without attribution (notice how as the conference proceeded my note-taking lagged!)

-   Oregon is pushing ahead on clean-tech jobs – 1 out of 100 workers now in clean tech jobs.
-   Wisconsin is investing in research  — especially alternative energy – they have already invested in Life Sciences and Medicine.  Now it is the energy sector’s turn.
-   Newfoundland/Labrador – energy warehouse of Canada.  Detailed ocean mapping technologies key.  Made the comment that our Canadian stimulus packages should have been about the green economy.  Hear. Hear.
-   Airlines like Virgin America are looking for efficient flight paths to minimize fuel.  Mentioned the need for a public policy context to make change in the airline industry.

And the next blog will be on Oceans.
