Chapter 3 of the BC Business Council’s Outlook 2020 series happened last week in the midst of all the other numerous events scheduled.  As a result, I only caught one of the sessions, missing the panel discussion on _Resourcing the Future:  BC’s Natural Advantage_ with Peter Woodbridge (who I am very impressed with – he authored the paper on the forest industry);  Randy Jespersen, President and CEO of Tersen; and Pierre Gratton, President and CEO of the Mining Association of BC.

The panel session that I did attend was called:  _Servicing the Future:  Creativity’s Competitive Advantage in Changing Times._ Moderated by Ida Goodreau, CEO of Lifelabs Medical Laboratory Services the session provided lots of good information about the potential of BC’s service sector.

In summary…

**Michael Goldberg – Dean Emeritus, Sauder School of Business, UBC**

-   There has been a dramatic growth in world exports of commercial services in the last couple of years;  US and EU are the dominant players – Canada is behind.  Trading in services grew 36.3% while trading in goods grew 26.8%.  And employment projections are for growth in the service sector.
-   Highlighted 10 exportable services – but health and education are key where we have large public expenditures and huge financial stress.
-   Keys to exporting tradeable services:  connectivity, high quality of life, education, health, public services and labour supply.
-   Challenges:  other regions are doing it too, can be slow to develop, goods matter and services don’t, trade barriers
-   Need to fund BC Stats to provide us with good information
-   See Mike’s paper at [www.bcbc.com](http://www.bcbc.com):  _Building the Economic Base:  Tradeable Services._

**Pascal Spothelfer – President and CEO of the BC Technology Industry Association**

-   In 1984 the tech sector in BC was 1.8% of GDP and in 2007 it was 5.9% — employs 81,000 people.
-   Strengths:  entrepreneurial foundation, breadth (life sciences, IT, new media, clean tech)
-   Weaknesses:  small companies, poor export performance
-   The tech industry needs more medium size/large companies to train and feed the management pool;  exports are essential – we need to find ways to enable smaller companies to become exporters;  we need to understand the sector and develop growth strategies.
-   The keys are supporting education and building HR capacity.
-   S & T is important to dealing with climate change, energy supply and human health.
-   See Pascal’s paper at [www.bcbc.com](http://www.bcbc.com):  _BC’s Advanced Technology Sector:  Reaching for the Next Level._

**Chris Thomas, QC – Consultant to Borden Ladner Gervais LLP**

-   Themes:  the Internet and Information Technology – the decoupling of services vis-à-vis geographic location; and, Infrastructure.
-   Singapore is “best in class” when it comes to tradeable services – they now operate over 28 ports around the world (YVR active in this area too).  The Singapore story is that they are short of water – so they have applied S & T to (1) improve catchment technology; (2) developed techniques for treating sewage; and (3) developing low energy desalination processes.  Singapore is now the world authority on “water” and provides consulting services globally.
-   We need to study our strengths and determine what we do well – and then unlock the economic opportunities – needs imagination and careful thought.
-   We can leverage our strong education and hard work.

**Ron Burnett, President of Vice-Chancellor, Emily Carr University of Art and Design**

-   It’s about creativity in the digital age – the creative economy and the cultural industries provide new opportunities.
-   The business value-add of design  — anecdotal examples – and we do use designed items and a designed world everyday.  MQ note:  where are the metrics on the value-add of design?  Research needed.
-   Opportunities in Health Design Engineering
-   Creative Sector – in 2007  $84.6B, 7.4% of GDP and 1.1 million jobs.
-   Opportunities in the new green economy.
-   See Ed Mansfield’s paper on:  the Creative Sector at [http://www.bcbc.com](http://www.bcbc.com).

**MQ Reflections:**

-   Am appreciative of the BCBC series – especially the papers that provide us with the key background information and context to understand where we are now and where we are headed from a future economic point of view.  Thank you BC Business Council.
-   Because I was going back and forth between the Outlook Series and the Resilient Cities conference, it was hard to miss the disconnect.   I was surprised at how the BCBC panels didn’t discuss the zero carbon or carbon-constrained economy and its opportunities.  Pascal mentioned some of the opportunities.   But there was no real discussion on how we are going to take advantage, in a creative and innovative way, of the change that is upon us .  Whereas at the Resilient Cities conference there were some really hard-nosed sessions on the economy, where it is going, what we could be and should be doing with some specific actions (next blog).
-   Need to get these two groups together – will be interesting to see the City of Vancouver’s Economic Development Plan which is coming soon.  Might be a good topic for a BCBC session.
