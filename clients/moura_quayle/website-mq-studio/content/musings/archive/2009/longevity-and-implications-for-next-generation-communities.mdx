  Archived blog post from 2009 exploring longevity and implications for next
  generation communities.

Axel Meisen (former President of Memorial University and now Chair of Foresight at the Alberta Research Council) challenged us to think about 3 issues “overnight”:

1.  What if we do move past fossil fuel – what are the implications for Alberta?
2.  Digital connectivity + infinite computer power available anywhere, anytime at low cost – global implications?
3.  Life Expectancy increasing – what if there are major extensions 120-150+ years?

Tuesday morning started with a discussion about these 3 high level issues.

**Would Alberta leave oil in the ground?**

-   How do you evaluate the environmental costs?
-   How do you look at alternative revenue?
-   What about alternative sources:  geothermal, solar?
-   What about research investments in nanotech & genomics?
-   Reference to a 1972 Harvard Business Review article on Marketing Myopia re: Amtrak.
-   It’s all about how Alberta defines itself – what is a rational transition?

**What about ubiquitous (more than now) digital connectivity and computer power?**

-   We are constrained by our ability to process the information—how do we train our brain to deal with this?
-   Knowledge is a commodity of abundance – we are going to need to re-design how we are going to be at the leading edge of knowledge creation.

**And, what about increasing life-expectancy…**

-   What are the implications?
-   Is longevity the bi-product of our biotechnology revolution?
-   What about the implications on our carbon footprints – for every person born we have to hand their footprint for twice as long.
-   If we lead a longer life – are we healthier because of improved diet?
-   We have to re-think our power relationships – what about the younger generation?   What about the way research (medical) seems to be moving from children to the elderly?
-   What about the financial infrastructure – fewer people working as needs for the elderly compete for resources.

Good discussion and good questions to ponder.  Many of us are in the so-called sandwich generation — children and parents to look after.  When you listen to David Baxter, our resident Vancouver demographer, you see quite a startling picture of the future.  And he isn’t using Axel’s quite radical speculation on how long we will live.
