Thanks to Ronna Chisholm, managing director of Dossier Creative, I signed up for Practivism II – an event sponsored by the Graphic Designers of Canada – BC Chapter.

From the website:  
_Practivism. It leverages design to catalyze the change our world requires. Designers are investigating the complex challenges facing the world, and our problem-solving abilities ae being put to the test. We’re asking each other and ourselves: can design ignite change? Can we design with people, not for people?_

The evening event featured 3 guest speakers:  
**Andrea Pellegrino…** _Worldstudio_ from Worldstudio—a NYC-based marketing and design firm.  
**Kara Pecknold…** _IDEO Human Centred Design Toolkit_ – designer researcher around the role of design in Health Care  
**Nathan Shedroff …**_Design is the Problem_ – Chair of the MBA in Design at the Califronia College of Arts (CCA) in San Francisco

The moderator of the evening was Valerie Elliott – president of the Society of Graphic Designers of Canada (GDC), Vancouver Island Chapter. Valerie has put sustainability on the GDC agenda, she wrote their sustainability principles and she now acts as an advisory to the American Institute of Graphic Artist’s Centre for Sustainable Design.

So there is a lot of action in the graphic design world. It was fascinating to be sitting in the audience (raising the average age considerably – thankful for the presence of the sponsors like Hemlock Printing who also had grey hair!) and listening to designers talk about design and social change. Yet these designers weren’t the ones I was used to listening to or talking with – these were generally not built environment designers — but as designers they cast their nets widely and broadly around the social change agenda.

A note on Hemlock Printers – they now have a carbon neutral printing option. In 2007 they initiated an environmental footprint calculator to calculate precise emissions from the printer process. [http://www.hemlock.com/company/news/53](http://www.hemlock.com/company/news/53 "Hemlock Printers").  Also kudos to Hemlock for creating a student scholarship .

The next couple of blogs will involve summaries of talks by Andrea, Kara and Nathan.
