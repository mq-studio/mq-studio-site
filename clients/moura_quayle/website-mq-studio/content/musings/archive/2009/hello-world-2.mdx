Hello world!   This is my first post in my new position as Professor at the UBC Sauder Business School.  I am really looking forward to joining the Sauder community — a great platform for continuing the work that I have been doing over the past year with the Pacific Coast Collaborative (www.pacificcoastcollaborative.org).

I did have an internal blog at the Ministry of Advanced Education — and I enjoyed the discipline of daily blogging — thinking through what my colleagues might be interested in knowing about and asking questions about the various projects we were involved in.

One of my main areas of interest as I begin this new chapter is the integration of collaborative design thinking and regional zero carbon economy opportunities into business education and practice.  I’m going to need to learn a lot about the business school and its culture which will be fun.

Anyway — will see how the blog unfolds.  Interest not to have the discipline of the 140 character tweet.
