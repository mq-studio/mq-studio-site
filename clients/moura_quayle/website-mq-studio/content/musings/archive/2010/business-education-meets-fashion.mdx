excerpt: Archived blog post from 2010 exploring business education meets fashion.

Several weeks ago FT  had a piece on fashion, business and law.  It talked about New York’s Laboratory Institute of Merchandising (LIM) introducing a new MBA focusing on fashion management.

_The fashion industry has been oriented toward creativity, but a business education is also needed to evolve and flourish.  Fashion is a business;  creativity plays a large role, but without business knowledge, prospects for success are limited._ Dr. Milan Milasinovic, dean of graduate studies and continuing education.

Here’s the link to LIM:  [http://www.limcollege.edu/academics/MBA-Fashion-Management-Entrepreneurship.aspx](http://www.limcollege.edu/academics/MBA-Fashion-Management-Entrepreneurship.aspx "LIM")

The London College of Fashion will be launching a new 2-year MBA in fashion in April 2011.

_Fashion companies have to operate in a post-financial crisis economy, demonstrating creativity and leadership in the management of their businesses.  The subjects will provide opportunities to reflect on how knowledge can enhance performance in their companies._ Tim Jackson, Principal lecturer overseeing MBA development

Sometimes when I think about what I wished I had done in my career — I sometimes imagine what it would have been like to be a fashion designer.  But I somehow think “liking” clothes isn’t quite enough of a leg-up in the fashion industry.

But interesting to see that there is acknowledgment around the importance of connecting business education with a range of discplines — like fashion.  Wonder whether the topic of sustainability has entered into the fashion schools in any meaningful way?
