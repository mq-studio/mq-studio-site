While the predominant experience during our UK sojourn so far has been urban — we have had some respite from election fever and the city frenzy.

Last weekend we walked from our abode across the pedestrian bridge to Waterloo Station and hopped a train to Winchester (yes, where the cathedral is).  Our friend Kim Wilkie picked us up at the station and drove us through the Hampshire countryside to Franklin Farm.   Kim’s parents bought the farm back in the 60s but it and its buildings have been around since the 17th Century.  Kim and his partner Pip are totally restoring the farmhouse, each brick has been cleaned and then re-pointed.

Under re-construction...

Twelve years ago, Kim participated in a woodlot planting program — he planted 4000 trees around the farm so there is now a wonderful woodland around the perimeter of the 30 acres.  He and Pip keep 6 or so long horned cattle — with names like Patience, Hope, Prospero etc.  Can’t remember the name of this one…

Kim (landscape architect) and Pip (landscape designer) have also created a series of exquisite spaces around the farmhouse and barn.
