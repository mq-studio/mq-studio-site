Having time to visit places that you just don’t get to if you only have a few days in London has been one of the joys of our experience here.  We seem to have fun when we have a “destination” and then we find sites and experiences along the way that we didn’t expect.

One day last week we set out towards two destinations — the Financial Services Authority (I know — how exciting is that — well it is to Dave for his governance work) which it turns out is located at Canary Wharf — and the Trafalgar Tavern in Greenwich (recommended by friend David Watson).

Bottom line — Canary Wharf (or at least the parts we saw) is very low quality urban design.  It is somewhat embarrassing that it is a Canadian development.  Anyway — here are some shots of what we saw…

We visited on one of the lowest of low days during the Greek crisis in the markets — so the banner around this building showed basically all the stocks with a “down” arrow.  Perhaps my dislike of Canary Wharf as we experienced it as pedestrians and on the DLR (light rapid transit that runs through the Wharf area) is that it seems to hold very little connection to its past or even to the river’s edge.  The spaces feel under-used — but perhaps that was because it was November-like and windy even though it was May.

We took the DLR to Greenwich and went in search of the Trafalgar Tavern (long walk).  We arrived to find that at 1:15pm the kitchen was already closed.

With that supposed destination found and dutifully photographed, we moved on to the Meridien — 0-0-0 and the Greenwich Mean-Time Clock.  The Greenwich Observatory is on a small-ish hill above the very large Maritime Museum.

Dave and I don’t normally queue for anything — but it seemed that we “should”  have our pictures taken on each side of the 0 Meridien.

So here we are — where east and west meet.
