Back at the blog.  Have missed it and the discipline it seems to bring to my life.  But always good to take a break.  I spent a lot of time over the last couple of weeks going through the detritus that has accumulated through years at UBC and then 4 years in the provincial government.  My studio in Nanaimo was looking like a recycling/shredding centre.  But it now has a semblance of order for which I am grateful.

I did unearth some interesting clippings that I’ll share over the next little while.  The first one is about Key Strategies for Managing Change.  I am always attracted to the idea of “X number” of strategies —  a definitive short number of actions to pursue.

This clip came from a column by Dev Patnaik in IN magazine June 2006.  The strategies are from the Founder of Jump Associates — an innovation strategy firm in San Mateo.  Find them at: [http://www.jumpassociates.com/](http://www.jumpassociates.com/ "Jump Associates")

So **Five Key Strategies for Managing Chang**e:

1\.  **Avoid the innovation title** — in other words don’t create an “innovation” department — better fly under the radar — the “Department of Vaguely Interesting Tangential Stuff That Might Pay Off Someday”.

2\.  **Use the buddy system** — we are need partners and helpers and supporters, especially during change.  As Patnaik suggests “these duos act as ying and yang, compensating for each others’s strengths and weaknesses.”

3\.  **Set the metrics in advance** — sometimes innovation teams produce new business ideas that can’t survive corporate scrutiny — maybe because companies measure success by focusing on incremental ideas.   “Successful innovators have been able to establish different sets of funding, testing and performance criteria.”  Set the metrics early.

4\.  **Aim for quick hits first** — as a change agent spend your early days on quick wins, easy ideas that demonstrate you know how to take action and get things done.

5\.  **Get data to back up your gut** — how do you know when you have a good idea?  Often just the sense you have — your intuition.  We rely on our experience but then we generally look for quantitative measures to justify our intuition to others.  And testing is also important for getting feedback.

Looking forward to 2010 and all the opportunities it will bring all of us.
