Am shifting my personal blog to mouraquayle.com (thanks to Kirk LaPointe giving me the gift of the domain name last Christmas!).

I want to blog more about reflections on city life — on Vancouver and other cities.  By city life, I mean observations and insights about how we go about living in a city — our joys and our frustrations.

Now that we live “right downtown Vancouver” there are new experiences to behold — and to write about on occasion.

Design/business integration and thinking strategy blogs are still to be found on the sauder studio site linked up in the header.
