Melbourne is abuzz with activity — lots of people on the street and tons of events t choose from.  There seem to be even more coffee places than in Vancouver.  And the quality is good (according to Dave).

On Saturday, we headed out to sample some of the comedy festival fare.  We chose DASH+D’BREE — or perhaps it is more accurate to say they chose us.  We happened to be zipping down one of Melbourne’s many urban lanes and we came upon a photo-shoot with Dash and D’Bree — they handed out a little flyer advertising their gig.

Billed as a “laugh out loud commentary on fashion, shopping and fame by two outrageous characters tipped to be the next Kath and Kim” they played to a small crowd in an upstairs room at the Portland Hotel in Melbourne.

And here they are — I think the fellow in the middle is their manager but not sure.  Anyway — it was fun to be entertained (mostly) for an hour by this energetic twosome — complete with pearls.
