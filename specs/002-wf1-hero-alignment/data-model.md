# Data Model Notes: WF1 â€“ Hero Alignment & Routes

No new domain entities are introduced in this iteration. The hero continues to render statically curated content while the upcoming CMS integration is scoped in future specs.

## Existing Structures
- `Hero` component consumes hard-coded copy/images; no API contract adjustments required.
- Placeholder routes will display static markdown-like copy with internal links.

## Future Considerations
- When dynamic feeds are introduced, revisit this document to capture artwork/publication/musing schemas and seasonal tuning metadata.
