# The Designed Life: A Comprehensive Report on the Career and Contributions of Professor Moura Quayle

## Section 1: Executive Summary

Professor Moura Quayle’s distinguished career represents a remarkable and consistent application of a core set of ideas across progressively complex domains. Trained as a landscape architect and urban designer, she has systematically scaled the principles of design—from shaping physical spaces to reshaping academic institutions, public policy, and leadership itself. This report details a professional journey characterized by a relentless drive to rethink, refine, and rebuild collaborative spaces at the intersections of academia, government, business, and civil society.1 The central theme, or "red thread," woven through her diverse roles is the concept of

**strategic design**: a disciplined, human-centered methodology for tackling complex challenges and creating elegant, effective solutions.

Professor Quayle has consistently operated as a "boundary crosser," moving fluidly between the theoretical world of the university and the pragmatic realities of public service and the private sector. Her tenure as a university dean, a provincial deputy minister, a director of global policy institutes, and a leader of national scientific organizations was not a series of disparate jobs, but rather a sequence of real-world laboratories. In these roles, she tested, refined, and validated the philosophy she would later codify in her seminal book, *Designed Leadership*. This experience endowed her with a rare and potent combination of academic rigor and practical wisdom, which culminated in one of her signature achievements: the founding of the University of British Columbia’s School of Public Policy and Global Affairs (SPPGA). The school, with its innovative Policy Studio at its core, stands as a testament to her vision of an education that is experiential, collaborative, and directly engaged with solving the "wicked problems" facing society.1

No account of Professor Quayle’s life and work is complete without acknowledging the profound intellectual and personal partnership she shared with her late husband, David S. Fushtey. A "Renaissance man" in his own right—a lawyer, sculptor, and governance expert—his work on "principled governance" provided a powerful complement to her work on designed leadership. His focus on the foundational principles of accountability, oversight, and the rule of law represented the "what" and "why" of effective decision-making, while her strategic design framework provided the practical "how." After his passing, her work to edit and publish his final book, *Principled Governance: When Everything Matters*, was not only an act of love and remembrance but also the ultimate expression of their shared mission: to bring clarity, principle, and thoughtful design to the complex art of getting things done.4

This report provides a comprehensive account of her education, professional appointments, key projects, publications, and personal pursuits. It is intended to serve as a foundational resource for the creation of a website that accurately and compellingly captures the full scope of her impact as an educator, a public servant, a thought leader, and a designer of better systems for a better world.

## Section 2: Foundations: Education and Early Career in Design

The intellectual and methodological foundation of Moura Quayle’s entire career was laid in the discipline of built environment design. Her formal education provided the core principles and practices that she would later adapt and apply to increasingly abstract and complex systems, from city-wide networks to organizational leadership and public policy.

### Academic Grounding

Professor Quayle’s academic journey began at the University of Guelph, where she earned a Bachelor of Landscape Architecture (BLA) in 1974.5 This was followed by a Master of Landscape Architecture (MLA) from the prestigious College of Environmental Design at the University of California, Berkeley.1 This training was immersive, teaching a holistic approach to problem-solving that balanced analytical rigor with creative generation, and instilled a deep understanding of the relationship between people, place, and systems. It was a discipline that, by its very nature, required one to "know place and experience," a concept that would become a central tenet of her later leadership philosophy.7 Her excellence was recognized by both institutions; the University of Guelph awarded her an honorary Doctor of Science in 2004, and UC Berkeley named her a Distinguished Alumna in 2009.1

### Early Professional Practice

Upon entering the professional world, Professor Quayle put her design training into immediate practice. She served as the principal of a private sector "built environment design business," an experience she would later reflect on as her time in a "start-up".7 Her firm, Quayle. Gauld, Earth Art Partners, engaged in community-level planning and environmental design, as evidenced by its work on the

*Coldstream Landscape Guidelines*.11 This project aimed to help the District of Coldstream in British Columbia maintain its visual quality and protect its natural resources through a series of detailed design principles for development.11 This early work demonstrates her engagement with the practical challenges of balancing development with environmental and aesthetic integrity.

An early sign of her collaborative professional and personal life appeared in 1991, with the publication of an article on Vancouver's "Coal Harbour" development in *Landscape Architecture* magazine, which she co-authored with her future husband, David S. Fushtey.12 This project was a complex, large-scale urban redevelopment that transformed an industrial waterfront into a vibrant, mixed-use community, and their joint analysis signaled a shared interest in the design and governance of urban spaces.13

### Pivotal Civic Contribution: The Vancouver Greenways Plan

A critical transition point in Professor Quayle's career, where her work began to scale from individual sites to city-wide systems, was her leadership of Vancouver's Urban Landscape Task Force in 1992.14 As chair of this influential body, she was the driving force behind the city's ambitious and celebrated Greenways Plan. The plan was a visionary project to create a network of linked, traffic-calmed "green streets" that would prioritize pedestrians and cyclists, connecting parks, neighborhoods, and public spaces across the entire city.15 Today, this network spans over 140 kilometers and is considered a landmark achievement in North American urban design.15

This project was far more than a landscape design exercise; it was a complex undertaking in public policy and civic engagement. It required extensive consultation, navigating political interests, and building a compelling public case for reallocating urban space. The principles articulated in the 1992 task force report reveal the early formation of her core philosophy. They included calls to "Make connections," "Encourage innovation," and "Be fair and equitable".15 These foundational ideas show a direct lineage to the more abstract principles she would later codify in

*Designed Leadership*. The Greenways project, therefore, was the crucible where her practice of strategic design was forged. It was here that she demonstrated the power of applying a design mindset to a complex, multi-stakeholder, public-good problem, cementing her reputation as a leader who could translate visionary ideas into tangible, transformative reality. Her career did not pivot *away* from landscape architecture; rather, this project was the moment she began to scale its core principles upward and outward, setting the stage for a lifetime of designing systems.

## Section 3: A Career in Academia: Leadership and Innovation at UBC

Moura Quayle's four-decade career at the University of British Columbia (UBC) is a compelling story of institutional entrepreneurship. Rather than simply managing existing structures, she actively created new ones, identifying institutional needs and applying her design methodology to build innovative pedagogical and administrative solutions from within. Her trajectory from a junior professor to a senior executive was marked by a series of strategic projects that fundamentally reshaped the university's approach to interdisciplinary teaching, research, and community engagement.

### Early Academic Career (1983–1997)

Moura Quayle joined UBC as an assistant professor in 1983, within the landscape architecture program then housed in the Department of Plant Science.3 She was promoted to the rank of full professor in 1995.17 Her early years were focused on the scholarship of teaching design. Publications from this period, such as

*Ideabook for teaching design* (1985) and the journal article "Techniques for encouraging reflection in design" (1989), demonstrate a deep interest in pedagogy and the cognitive processes of designers.12 Her excellence in the classroom was quickly recognized with a Distinguished Teaching Award from the Council of Educators in Landscape Architecture in 1987 and a UBC Killam Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1990, two of the highest honors for university-level instruction.1

### Dean, Faculty of Land and Food Systems (1997–2005)

Her appointment as Dean marked her first major senior leadership role, a position she held for eight years.17 This was her first opportunity to apply design principles to the complex system of an entire academic faculty. Her leadership involved strategic planning, curriculum renewal, and fostering interdisciplinary initiatives that broke down traditional academic silos. A key project from this era was "Re-inventing the UBC farm," a 2000 initiative that explored the potential for urban agriculture and forestry on campus, blending research, teaching, and community outreach in a living laboratory.12

### Associate VP, Academic Programs, UBC Okanagan (2004–2005)

Professor Quayle played a crucial role in the formative years of UBC's second major campus in the Okanagan Valley.17 This experience was akin to a "start-up" within a large, established institution. She was tasked with helping to design academic programs and physical structures from the ground up, a process captured in the development of the 2005 UBC Okanagan Master Plan.19 This role honed her skills in building new systems and fostering a distinct academic culture in a new environment.

### Director, Liu Institute for Global Issues (2014–2017)

After a significant period in public service, Professor Quayle returned to a direct leadership role at UBC as the Director of the Liu Institute for Global Issues, a prominent research hub focused on development, security, and social justice.17 This appointment marked a pivotal shift in her focus. Having spent several years at the Sauder School of Business developing design-based approaches to business innovation, she now turned her attention to applying these same methods to complex global policy challenges.1 This transition laid the intellectual groundwork for her next major undertaking.

### Founding Director, School of Public Policy and Global Affairs (SPPGA) (2017–2019)

The creation of the SPPGA stands as a capstone achievement in her academic career. As the founding Director *pro tem*, she did not just inherit a school; she designed one from its very foundations.3 The school's curriculum, structure, and ethos are a direct application of her

*Designed Leadership* philosophy. Central to this was her creation of **The Policy Studio**, a signature pedagogical innovation described as "both a place and a pedagogy".1 The Studio is built on the strategic design method, convening interdisciplinary teams to co-create, prototype, and launch solutions to real-world "wicked-system problems".1 Its projects have been diverse and impactful, including a 3-day studio with the Government of Canada in Ottawa, a "Resilient City Policy Challenge" with students from Sciences Po in Paris to tackle social connectedness in Vancouver, and foundational research that helped create the UBC Knowledge Exchange unit.1 The Policy Studio is the ultimate expression of her educational philosophy, moving policy studies from the theoretical to the applied.

### Vice-Provost and Associate Vice-President, Academic Affairs (2020–2024)

In her most recent senior role, Professor Quayle's portfolio expanded to the entire UBC Vancouver campus, overseeing faculty affairs, recruitment, retention, and academic planning.4 She was a key figure in the university's high-level strategic direction, having previously chaired the UBC Strategic Plan Steering Committee from 2017 to 2018.17 In this capacity, she continued to champion interdisciplinary collaboration, calling for "boldness and innovation" in strategic planning and emphasizing the critical importance of knowledge exchange between the university and the wider community.22 Her retirement in 2024 was met with deep gratitude from university leadership, who celebrated her transformative legacy and her "innate ability to bring warmth, color and a unique lens to everything she engaged with".3

## Section 4: The Philosophy of 'Designed Leadership'

At the intellectual heart of Moura Quayle's diverse career is a coherent and powerful philosophy she calls "Designed Leadership." This concept, articulated in her 2017 book and refined through decades of practice, posits that the mindset, tools, and techniques of designers can be systematically applied to make leaders more effective, creative, and accountable. It is a philosophy of "principled pragmatism," focused on a disciplined process for getting things done in a world of increasing complexity.7

### The Book: Designed Leadership

Published by Columbia University Press in 2017, *Designed Leadership* is the definitive statement of her approach.1 The book’s central premise is that great leaders manage "by design"—with purpose and foresight—and that the proven principles of the design disciplines can transform managers into "collaborative, creative, deliberate, and accountable visionaries".24 Reviews of the book highlight its unique value, noting that it is differentiated from the wave of literature on "design thinking" by the sheer breadth of Quayle's experience in landscape architecture, urban policy, government, and academia.1 Critics praised it as an "immediately applicable" guide that is academic without being dry, offering practical tools and processes grounded in a rich intellectual history.1

### Core Methodology: The ASK.TRY.DO. Framework

To make the strategic design process accessible and memorable, Professor Quayle developed a simple yet robust framework while teaching business innovation at the UBC Sauder School of Business: ASK.TRY.DO..7 This three-stage method provides a clear, repeatable process for tackling complex problems.

**ASK:** This initial phase is about deep inquiry and research. It involves discovering the context, defining the true nature of the problem, and scoping the challenge. It is about finding facts, uncovering meaning, and identifying genuine opportunities before rushing to a solution.26 This stage is analogous to due diligence in a business or legal context.

**TRY:** This is the generative and iterative phase. It involves brainstorming a wide range of ideas, building prototypes (whether physical models, process diagrams, or policy scenarios), and testing them against defined criteria. This stage embraces ambiguity and "failing fast" to learn and refine concepts.26 It is a form of active risk management.

**DO:** This is the implementation phase. It involves making clear decisions about budgets, timelines, and responsibilities, followed by monitoring, evaluation, and follow-up. It closes the loop by ensuring accountability and capturing lessons learned for future improvement.23

### The Ten Principles of Designed Leadership

Underpinning the ASK.TRY.DO. method is a set of ten guiding principles derived from theories of built environment design. These principles serve as strategic markers to link an organization's values to its actions.1 Professor Quayle has elaborated on these principles in her book and a series of guest posts.7

**Make Values Explicit:** The foundational principle. Values must be clearly stated and used transparently in daily decision-making to serve as touchstones for accountability.28

**Know Place and Experience:** Leaders must understand the context—the physical, cultural, and historical environment—in which they operate, as well as their own personal "home landscapes" that shape their perspectives.8

**Value Diversity:** This goes beyond demographics to include a diversity of perspectives. It is an exercise in empathy, requiring leaders to constantly step into the shoes of others—children, seniors, different stakeholders—to assess the impact of decisions.8

**Emphasize Edges and Boundaries:** Innovation often happens at the intersections between disciplines, departments, or sectors. Leaders should pay close attention to these "edges" as places of creative potential.

**Bridge Gaps and Make Connections:** A core function of leadership is to connect disparate ideas, people, and systems to create a more coherent and functional whole.

**Evaluate for Fit, Scale, and Context:** Solutions are not one-size-fits-all. They must be appropriate for the specific problem, scalable to the right level, and sensitive to the surrounding context.

**Learn from Natural Systems:** Natural ecosystems offer powerful models of resilience, adaptation, and efficiency that can inform organizational design and strategy.

**Apply the Jane Jacobs Test:** Named for the famed urbanist, this principle champions mixed uses, permeable thinking, and a human-scale, ground-up perspective over rigid, top-down planning.

**Attend to Patterns:** Effective leaders are skilled at recognizing and interpreting patterns in data, behavior, and systems to anticipate trends and identify opportunities.

**Never Finished but Always Complete:** This principle captures the iterative nature of design. A project or plan can be complete for its current stage, but it is never permanently finished; it should always be open to learning, adaptation, and improvement.

### Pedagogical Innovations: d.studio and Policy Studio

Professor Quayle did not confine these ideas to the pages of a book; she built them into living educational programs. The **d.studio** at the UBC Sauder School of Business was her first major institutional application of this philosophy, creating a hands-on, project-based course where business students learned to solve complex challenges using design methods.16 She then evolved this model into the

**Policy Studio** at the SPPGA, adapting the strategic design method for the unique complexities of public policy innovation.1 These studios are the pedagogical embodiment of her philosophy, training the next generation of leaders to think and act like designers.

The concepts of "Designed Leadership" and her husband's "Principled Governance" are not separate philosophies but are deeply intertwined. If principled governance defines the essential foundations of good decision-making—accountability, transparency, and the rule of law—then designed leadership provides the operational framework for achieving it. The ASK.TRY.DO. process is a practical methodology for conducting due diligence, managing risk, and ensuring accountability. Making values explicit is the first step toward any form of principled action. Her work provides the *how* for his *why*, creating a unified and powerful vision for effective, ethical leadership in a complex world.

## Section 5: Bridging Town and Gown: Civic Engagement and Public Service

A defining characteristic of Moura Quayle’s career is her sustained and impactful engagement in the world beyond the university campus. Her periods in public service were not detours from her academic path but were strategic, real-world applications of her design-led philosophy. These roles served as high-stakes laboratories where she tested and refined the principles of designed leadership at senior levels of government and policy-making, granting her a unique credibility and depth of practical insight that she brought back to her academic work.

### Deputy Minister, B.C. Ministry of Advanced Education (2005–2008)

From 2005 to 2008, Professor Quayle was seconded to the Government of British Columbia to serve as the Deputy Minister of Advanced Education.1 This is one of the most senior non-elected positions in provincial government, making her responsible for the oversight of all 25 public post-secondary institutions in the province, as well as research and technology portfolios.17 This immersive experience provided her with an insider’s view of the machinery of government, the complexities of public administration, and the political dynamics that shape policy. This practical understanding of the "structural and cognitive barriers" inherent in large bureaucracies would prove invaluable in her later work designing a policy school that was grounded in the realities of governance.7

### B.C. Commissioner, Pacific Coast Collaborative (2008 onwards)

Following her term as Deputy Minister, she was appointed the B.C. Commissioner for the Pacific Coast Collaborative.1 This high-level initiative brings together the leaders of British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California, and Alaska to collaborate on shared challenges, with a primary focus on combating climate change, protecting the ocean environment, and building a thriving, low-carbon regional economy.31 Her role in this commission placed her at the nexus of inter-governmental relations, environmental policy, and economic strategy on an international scale, exemplifying her ability to facilitate collaboration across jurisdictions to address systemic problems.

### Chair, Genome Canada

Professor Quayle has also served as the Chair of the Board of Directors for Genome Canada.1 Genome Canada is a national not-for-profit organization that leads Canada's genomics strategy, investing in large-scale science and technology to fuel innovation in key sectors like health, agriculture, and the environment.33 Her leadership in this capacity demonstrates the versatility of her strategic design approach, applying it to the governance of a highly specialized and technical scientific organization. It underscores her ability to guide complex institutions at the forefront of national science and innovation policy.

### CityStudio Vancouver

Professor Quayle was a pivotal figure in the creation of CityStudio Vancouver, an innovative collaboration launched in 2011 to connect university students and faculty with City of Vancouver staff to co-create solutions for urban challenges.35 While Dr. Janet Moore and Duane Elverum are credited as the co-founders, Professor Quayle's role was foundational.35 She led the

**Campus-City Collaborative (C3)**, the umbrella initiative that brought together the city with its six post-secondary institutions, and CityStudio was established as C3's signature program.41 As a member of Vancouver's Greenest City Action Team, she was instrumental in formulating the very concept of this city-campus partnership.41 Early organizational documents list her in an "Executive Leadership" capacity.38 CityStudio perfectly embodies her lifelong work of creating collaborative spaces at the intersection of academia and government, using the city itself as a classroom and laboratory for tangible, project-based learning.

These roles collectively demonstrate a career dedicated to breaking down the walls between "town and gown." The experience gained as a senior government official and a leader of national and regional collaborations provided the ultimate "ASK" and "TRY" phases for her academic work. When she returned to UBC to found the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs, she did so with an unparalleled understanding of the practical challenges of governance, enabling her to design a program uniquely equipped to prepare students for impactful careers in public service.

## Section 6: A Partnership in Life and Intellect: Moura Quayle and David Fushtey

The life and work of Moura Quayle are inextricably linked with that of her late husband, David Stewart Fushtey. Theirs was a profound partnership that extended beyond the personal to the professional and intellectual, creating a synergy of ideas that has left a lasting legacy. His work on the principles of governance and her work on the process of design were not parallel tracks but deeply complementary philosophies that informed and enriched one another.

### David S. Fushtey (1955–2019): A Renaissance Man

David Fushtey was, by all accounts, a true "Renaissance man" with a remarkable breadth of talent and passion.42 Born in Guelph, Ontario, on August 21, 1955, his career path was eclectic and distinguished.42 Like Moura, he began his career with a degree in landscape architecture. He served as a senior planner for the landmark Expo '86 in Vancouver before pursuing a law degree at UBC, graduating in 1988.42 As a lawyer, he worked in international transactions and as in-house counsel, developing a deep expertise in corporate and commercial law.44

Beyond his legal and design work, he was a passionate sculptor, working primarily in stone. He loved music, art, and beauty, and his artistic sensibility was a core part of his identity.43 His commitment to the rule of law was equally profound, grounded in a belief in "discipline, justice and consideration of others".42 He passed away on October 8, 2019, after a battle with a brain tumour.43

### The Governance Counsel and Principled Governance™

In 2002, David Fushtey founded **The Governance Counsel**, a firm dedicated to his core passion: governance, which he defined as "the effective exercise of informed authority".42 Known as the "Governance Guy," he advised directors and managers in business and civil society for decades.43 He developed a unique approach called

**Principled Governance™** and a set of tools known as the **Governance Platform™**, which included educational protocols and briefing materials to help organizations navigate their governance challenges and, as he simply put it, to "get along".43

### Intellectual Legacy: His Publications

David Fushtey's life's work on governance culminated in two major publications.

***The Director and The Manager: Law & Governance in a Digital Age—Machiavelli Had it Easy***: Published in May 2019, this nearly 1000-page magnum opus is a comprehensive academic text that presents his research and a market-tested decision-making framework for governance in the modern era.42 It is a deep, scholarly exploration of comparative law, market practice, and human nature within the strategic oversight role of governance.43

***Principled Governance: When Everything Matters***: After David's death, his extensive work was distilled into this accessible, 106-page handbook. Published in 2021, it was designed to be an essential guide for directors, managers, and students, drawing out the most useful and crucial lessons from his larger text.48

### Moura Quayle's Role as Editor and Steward of His Legacy

Moura Quayle was instrumental in bringing *Principled Governance* to fruition. Alongside editor Richard Littlemore, she took on the immense task of reviewing and revising his 1000-page volume to create the concise and engaging guide.4 She is credited as an editor, wrote the foreword, and even provided stylish illustrations for the book, making it a deeply personal and professional tribute.52 In her own words, David was her primary inspiration, a "wise and insightful" man whose encouragement gave her the sense that she "could do anything in life".18

This act of editing was, in itself, an exercise in strategic design. It required a deep understanding of the end-user (practitioners and students) and a process of synthesis, clarification, and communication to translate a dense, complex work into an accessible and impactful format. She applied her own design skills to ensure his intellectual legacy would reach the widest possible audience, making it the ultimate collaborative project of their shared intellectual journey.

### Community and Artistic Work: Stoneworks and Public Art

David Fushtey's commitment to community and art found expression in his **"Stoneworks"** program, an initiative he started for street-involved youth, born from his own love of stone sculpture.42 While detailed records of the program are sparse, its existence speaks to his desire to share his passion and provide opportunities for vulnerable youth.42 His own sculptures are part of the public realm, with pieces like "CuTArT Crossroads: Community Seat" in Vancouver and "Celebration: Seasons of Life in a Global Village" in Richmond, B.C., leaving a permanent physical mark on the landscape.55

## Section 7: The Designer's Eye: Art, Aesthetics, and Personal Pursuits

Beyond her formal professional roles, Moura Quayle’s personal interests reveal a consistent and deeply integrated aesthetic sensibility. Her pursuits in art, language, and even the curation of her work environment are not separate from her professional identity but are extensions of it, reflecting the core principles of design, continuous learning, and the importance of place and experience that define her philosophy.

### Artistic Practices

Professor Quayle has a stated interest in **watercolour painting** and **Chinese calligraphy (shufa)**.4 Her engagement with calligraphy, which she began exploring with her husband David before a planned trip to Shanghai, is particularly telling.18 Shufa is a discipline that demands precision, balance, rhythm, and an profound appreciation for form and negative space. It is a meditative practice that trains the hand and the eye to achieve an elegance born of deep discipline. These are the very same qualities that characterize effective design, whether of a landscape, a product, or a strategic plan. Her artistic practice is a parallel expression of the design mindset that she champions in leadership. Her skill is evident in the stylish illustrations she contributed to the posthumous publication of her husband's book,

*Principled Governance*.53

### Commitment to Lifelong Learning

Her interest in **learning Mandarin** further underscores a commitment to lifelong learning and cross-cultural understanding.4 This endeavor, undertaken later in her career, demonstrates an intellectual curiosity and humility—a willingness to be a novice again—that she identifies as a key quality of a good leader.18 It reflects a genuine desire to engage with different worldviews, a practice essential for anyone working in global policy and affairs.

### Aesthetics in the Workplace

A small but powerful anecdote from her colleagues at UBC reveals how deeply her design philosophy is integrated into her daily practice. She was affectionately known as an "office florist," with a unique habit of transforming institutional spaces with her thoughtful inclusion of flowers, which "added vibrancy and life to the work environment".3 This gesture is a micro-application of her macro-level principles. It is a tangible demonstration of the idea that the design of our environment directly impacts our well-being, creativity, and relationships. It reflects her belief in "knowing place and experience" and her "innate ability to bring warmth, color and a unique lens to everything she engaged with".3 For Professor Quayle, design is not an abstract concept confined to a studio or a boardroom; it is a lived practice that finds expression in every aspect of her life.

**David Stewart Fushtey (August 21, 1955 – October 8, 2019)**

David Fushtey was a distinguished Canadian lawyer, landscape architect, sculptor, and governance expert. A true "Renaissance man," his career was marked by a diverse range of passions and a deep commitment to the rule of law, justice, and community service.42 He earned a degree in landscape architecture before serving as a senior planner for Expo '86 in Vancouver. He later earned his law degree (LLB) from the University of British Columbia in 1988, where he was editor of the
