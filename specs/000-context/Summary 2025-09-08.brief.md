# Strategic Foundation Brief

## Purpose

This strategic foundation document establishes the core principles, design philosophy, and architectural requirements for the MQ Studio website. It defines Moura Quayle's authentic voice, the triadic MQ Framework (Thinking/Feeling/Doing), and the holistic "whole person" brand that integrates her roles as designer, scholar, and artist. This document directly informs site architecture, component design, content strategy, and visual identity.

## Decisive Takeaways

• **MQ Framework Implementation**: Homepage hero must display three simultaneous entry points (THINKING/FEELING/DOING) with equal visual weight and clear CTAs
• **Living Studio Concept**: Site functions as active workspace, not static portfolio - content shows work-in-progress, experiments, and rough drafts alongside finished pieces
• **Integrated Voice**: Moura's content is invitational ("I've been wondering..."), exploratory, grateful, uncertain, and connective - never authoritative or sales-oriented
• **David's Presence**: Late husband Dave appears as marginalia quotes, governance annotations, and "Conversations with David" series - woven throughout, not segregated
• **Seasonal Adaptation**: Visual system subtly changes with seasons (spring watercolors, fall calligraphy prominence, winter deeper reflections)
• **Three-Content-Types Structure**: "Experiences, Experiments, Rough Drafts & Finished Works" taxonomy drives content organization across all sections
• **Persona-Driven Navigation**: Primary user "Dr. Alisha Sharma" - mid-career academic seeking credible resources, intellectual inspiration, and authentic connection
• **Non-Commercial Positioning**: Zero sales intent removes marketing feel, focuses entirely on sharing and relationship-building

## Constraints & Non-Negotiables

• **Color System**: Moura Teal (#00A8A8) primary, Living Pink (#E91E63) feeling sections, Scholar Blue (#2C5985) David's work, Shufa Red (#8D2305) signature moments, Rice Paper (#FDFCF8) background
• **Typography Lock**: Montserrat for headings/navigation, Lora for body text - no exceptions
• **Accessibility Minimum**: 4.5:1 contrast ratio, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility
• **Voice Guidelines**: Must sound invitational, exploratory, grateful, uncertain, connective - never authoritative or selling
• **MQ Framework Enforcement**: Every major page section must reflect THINKING/FEELING/DOING integration
• **Homepage Hero Requirements**: Must show three elements simultaneously with themed entry points
• **David Integration**: His voice appears as marginalia and annotations, never as separate section
• **Seasonal Responsiveness**: Color accents and content prominence shift with calendar seasons
• **Content Dating**: All content must show evolution timeline, include questions without answers

## Open Questions

• **Musings Audio Implementation**: Technical requirements for accessible audio player with analytics tracking unclear
• **Resonance Engine Scope**: How sophisticated should the conceptual/temporal/material connection system be for MVP vs future iterations?
• **Filtering Complexity**: Publications need tag-based filtering - what's the taxonomy depth and UI pattern?
• **Mobile Marginalia**: How do David's margin quotes reflow on mobile screens without losing context?
• **Seasonal Trigger Logic**: What drives seasonal color/content shifts - calendar dates, manual curation, or content analysis?
• **Search vs Browse Balance**: Primary navigation unclear between powerful search and thematic browsing
• **Content Migration**: How much existing content needs restructuring into new "experiences/experiments/drafts/finished" taxonomy?

## Canonical Quotes

> "Moura values people, relationships, and connection. Her purpose is not to build a static library; it is to build a working studio of curated 'experiences, experiments, rough drafts and finished works' where she can welcome people she knows or meets and share with them something of the many sides to her."

> "This isn't about switching between modes—it's about their constant interplay. The website should reflect this triadic nature."
[source: Summary 2025-09-08, MQ Framework]

> "The site should feel like spending an afternoon in Moura's actual studio-study, where a governance paper might be drying next to a watercolor, where David's books share shelves with art supplies, and where every visit reveals new conversations between different ways of knowing."
[source: Summary 2025-09-08, Ultimate Vision]

> "Stop presenting finished thoughts. Instead: Show work in progress, Include questions without answers, Let contradictions exist, Feature failed experiments alongside successes, Date everything to show evolution of thinking."
[source: Summary 2025-09-08, Content Philosophy]

> "Use Montserrat font for all headings, titles, and navigation elements. Use Lora font for all body text, paragraphs, and content areas. Apply font-weight: 500 for Montserrat headings and font-weight: 400 for Lora body text."
