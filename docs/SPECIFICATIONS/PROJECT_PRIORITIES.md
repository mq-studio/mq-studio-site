# MQ Studio Project Priorities

**Created:** 2025-10-28
**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ Active
**Purpose:** Document core project priorities to guide all implementation decisions

## Core Project Priorities (In Order)

### 1. **Great Aesthetic Design**
- Visual excellence and artistic presentation
- Reflects Moura's design sensibility
- Creates an inspiring digital studio environment
- Prioritizes beauty and elegance in interface

### 2. **Great Visitor Experience**
- Intuitive navigation and discovery
- Fast, responsive performance
- Accessible to all users
- Engaging content presentation
- Seamless cross-device experience

### 3. **Great Administrator Experience**
- Ease of content management
- Simple maintenance workflows
- Clear documentation
- Intuitive updating processes
- Support for iterative improvements

## Non-Priorities

### SEO Optimization
- **Context:** This is a personal project for Moura, not primarily focused on search rankings
- **Implication:** We prioritize user experience and aesthetics over SEO tactics
- **Note:** We still follow SEO best practices where they align with UX, but don't compromise design for rankings

## Decision Framework

When making implementation choices, evaluate options against these priorities:

1. Does it enhance the aesthetic quality?
2. Does it improve visitor experience?
3. Does it simplify administration?
4. If there's conflict, prioritize in the order listed above

## Examples of Priority-Driven Decisions

### URL Structure
- **SEO-optimized:** `/2017/10/01/post-title/` (preserves exact WordPress URLs)
- **User-optimized:** `/musings/post-title/` (cleaner, easier to remember)
- **Decision:** User-optimized, as SEO is not a priority

### Legacy Content Presentation
- **SEO-optimized:** Maintain all original formatting and structure
- **Design-optimized:** Thoughtful visual integration with modern content
- **Decision:** Design-optimized with subtle legacy indicators

### Media Handling
- **Performance-optimized:** Aggressive compression, lazy loading
- **Quality-optimized:** Higher quality images that showcase Moura's visual work
- **Decision:** Balance toward quality within reasonable performance bounds

## Implementation Notes

- All features should be evaluated against these priorities
- When in doubt, choose the simpler, more maintainable solution
- Aesthetic design includes both visual design and code elegance
- Administrator experience includes future AI agents working on the codebase
