## 7. Decisions Made

### Content Strategy âœ…
1. **Frequency**: ~2 posts per month average
2. **Length**: Paragraph to 2 pages for text; ~3 minutes for video updates
3. **Video Hosting**: YouTube (free, performant, SEO benefits)
4. **Comments**: Enabled (need moderation strategy)
5. **Social Integration**: TBD - defer to Phase 2

### Technical Decisions âœ…
1. **CMS Evolution**: Stay file-based (MDX)
2. **Video Storage**: YouTube embeds (no self-hosting costs)
3. **Authentication**: TBD - needs discussion
4. **Analytics**: TBD - consider in Phase 2
5. **Email Notifications**: Yes, needed (implementation TBD)

### Content Categorization Strategy
Based on existing multimedia archive analysis:
- **Musings**: Informal updates, reflections, thought pieces
- **Publications**: Formal presentations, academic talks, keynotes
- **Media/Press**: Third-party interviews, podcasts, coverage
- Existing YouTube content can be embedded in appropriate categories

### Design Considerations
1. **Visual Hierarchy**: How prominent vs. publications?
2. **Homepage Integration**: Featured musings section?
3. **Navigation**: New menu item or under existing section?
4. **Mobile Experience**: Video playback optimization?

## 8. Implementation Notes

### Recommended Approach
1. **Phase 1**: Written posts only, basic categorization
2. **Phase 2**: Add video support, enhanced filtering
3. **Phase 3**: Scheduling, series, social features

### Comments Implementation
Given the decision to enable comments:
1. **Phase 1**: Use Disqus or Utterances (GitHub-based)
2. **Moderation**: Pre-moderation for first-time commenters
3. **Spam Protection**: reCAPTCHA or similar
4. **Alternative**: Consider Giscus (GitHub Discussions-based)

### Email Subscription Implementation
1. **Service Options**:
   - Buttondown (developer-friendly, markdown support)
   - ConvertKit (creator-focused)
   - Mailchimp (if already using)
2. **Integration**: API-based subscription form
3. **Automation**: Auto-send new musings digest
