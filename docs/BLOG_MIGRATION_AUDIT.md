## Technical Migration Considerations

### Content Structure

Source Format: WordPress.com hosted blog
Export Format: WordPress XML (WXR format)
Target Format: MDX files in Next.js

Data Available:
  - Post title, slug, date, author
  - Full HTML content
  - Categories (mostly "Uncategorized")
  - Tags (minimal usage)
  - Comment status
  - Publication status

Data Challenges:
  - Images hosted on multiple domains
  - No automatic image export
  - Timezone inconsistencies in dates
  - Limited metadata/categorization
```

### Media Asset Migration

#### Image Sources Identified
1. **WordPress CDN:** `mouraquayle.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/`
2. **Twitter/X:** `pbs.twimg.com` (may require backup)
3. **Gravatar:** Author avatars
4. **External PDFs:** Event flyers and reports

#### Migration Strategy Required
- Download and backup all WordPress-hosted images
- Create local copies of external images where possible
- Update all image URLs in content
- Implement responsive image optimization

### URL Structure Preservation

#### Current URL Pattern
```
/YYYY/MM/DD/post-slug/
Example: /2017/10/01/photos-from-designed-leadership-book-launches/
```

#### Recommended Approach
1. Maintain exact URL structure for SEO
2. Implement 301 redirects from WordPress.com
3. Create redirect mapping document
4. Monitor 404 errors post-migration

3. **Document current URLs** for redirect mapping

### Migration Approach

// Recommended schema addition for legacy content
interface LegacyMusing extends Musing {
  legacy: true;
  originalUrl: string;
  wordpressId: string;
  importDate: Date;
  archiveNote?: string;
  originalCategories?: string[];
  mediaAssets: {
    original: string;
    local: string;
    type: 'image' | 'document';
  }[];
}
```

## Phase 0.5 Elicitation: Questions for Clarification

Before proceeding with implementation:

1. **Content Curation:** Should all 79 posts be imported, or would you like to review and exclude certain categories (e.g., travel/food posts)?

2. **Editorial Enhancement:** Do you want to add introductory context to older posts? Update outdated information?

3. **URL Structure:** Maintain WordPress date-based URLs (/2017/10/01/) or simplify to (/musings/post-slug/)?

4. **Media Handling:** Budget for image storage? Preference for CDN service?

5. **Legacy Presentation:** How prominently feature archived content vs. new musings?

6. **WordPress.com Account:** Do you have admin access for full export?

---

## Conclusion

The audit confirms that Moura's WordPress blog represents valuable intellectual capital worth preserving in the new MQ Studio site. The content documents important professional milestones, showcases thought leadership evolution, and adds depth to the "living archive" concept.

**Migration is technically feasible** using WordPress export tools and standard conversion pipelines. The main effort will be in image migration and URL redirect mapping.

**Content quality justifies the import effort**, particularly the academic posts (2009-2011) and Designed Leadership materials (2017) which directly support the site's mission.
