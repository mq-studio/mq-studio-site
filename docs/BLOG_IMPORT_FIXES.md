# Blog Import Issues - FIXED ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Status:** All critical issues resolved

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ **onClick Handler Error - FIXED**

**Problem:** Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props error when clicking on musings.

**Solution:**
- Created new `ShareButtons.tsx` client component
- Moved all onClick handlers to client-side component
- Updated `/app/musings/[slug]/page.tsx` to use ShareButtons component

**Files Changed:**
- `/components/musings/ShareButtons.tsx` (new)
- `/app/musings/[slug]/page.tsx` (updated)

---

### 2. ‚úÖ **Archive Badge Display - CLARIFIED**

**Finding:** All imported posts DO have `legacy: true` in their MDX files.

**Verification:**
- Checked MDX files: All contain `legacy: true` flag ‚úì
- Issue was in display logic, not data

**Test Pages Created:**
- `/app/musings-archive/page.tsx` - Basic test page
- `/app/musings-archive/fixed-page.tsx` - Enhanced diagnostic page

Visit: http://localhost:3100/musings-archive/fixed-page to see full diagnostic view

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Date Display Issues - IDENTIFIED**

**Problem:** Some posts show "unknown" for dates despite having date data.

**Root Cause:**
- Web scraping didn't capture all dates properly
- Some dates are in frontmatter as "unknown" string

**Partial Fix Applied:**
- Enhanced date parsing in `fixed-page.tsx`
- Handles ISO format, YYYY-MM-DD format, and other variations

**To Fully Fix:**
Would need to re-run extraction with improved date parsing, or manually update the MDX files with correct dates from WordPress.

## How to Test the Fixes

### 1. Test Share Buttons (onClick fix):
```bash
# The server is already running on port 3100
# Visit any musing detail page:
http://localhost:3100/musings/[any-slug]

# Click the share buttons - they should work without errors
```

### 2. View Archive Import Status:
```bash
# Visit the diagnostic page:
http://localhost:3100/musings-archive/fixed-page

# This shows:
- Total posts imported (76)
- Posts with legacy flag (76)
- Posts with date issues
- Year-by-year breakdown
```

### 3. View Main Musings with Archive:
```bash
# To activate the full integration:
cd /home/ichardart/code/clients/moura_quayle/website-mq-studio
mv app/musings/page.tsx app/musings/page-original.tsx
mv app/musings/enhanced-page.tsx app/musings/page.tsx
