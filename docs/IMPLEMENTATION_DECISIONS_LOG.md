# MQ Studio Implementation Decisions Log

## Decision: Integrated Pathways Architecture
**Date**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: APPROVED - Phase 1 Implementation
**Decision Maker**: Project Stakeholder
**Context**: Homepage hero section architecture

### Problem
Original THINKING-FEELING-DOING framework created artificial one-to-one mapping with content types (Publications/Artworks/Musings), resulting in contradictions:
- FEELING mapped exclusively to Art, but Calligraphy was classified as DOING
- Publications could be deeply emotional but were restricted to THINKING
- Musings containing rigorous analysis couldn't be classified as THINKING

### Considered Options

#### Option 1: Remove Thinking-Feeling-Doing Framework
- **Pros**: Eliminates contradictions, simpler architecture
- **Cons**: Loses philosophical framework central to MQ Studio concept
- **Decision**: REJECTED - Framework is core to the studio concept

#### Option 2: Integrated Pathways (SELECTED)
- **Description**: Each modality (THINKING/FEELING/DOING) shows how it appears across all content types
- **Example**: THINKING pathway could show a governance paper, conceptual artwork, or analytical musing
- **Pros**: Honors complexity, maintains framework, reflects authentic interconnectedness
- **Cons**: Higher complexity, curation burden

#### Option 3: Matrix Navigation
- **Description**: 3×3 grid allowing any content type through any modality lens
- **Pros**: Maximum flexibility
- **Cons**: Cognitive overload, overwhelming choice architecture
- **Decision**: REJECTED - Too complex for initial implementation

### Implementation Approach: Phased Rollout

#### Phase 1: Minimal Viable Complexity (APPROVED)
- One featured item per pathway (3 total items on homepage)
- Manual curation process
- Simple content tagging system
- Preserve existing color system (colors = modalities)

#### Phase 2: Enhanced Discovery (Future)
- Multiple items per pathway with "see more" options
- Rotation algorithms for featured content
- Editorial interface improvements

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)
- User preference learning
- Dynamic recommendations
- Advanced content relationships

### Technical Implications

#### Data Architecture Changes
- Content schema enhanced with modality-specific descriptions
- Featured flags per modality per content piece
- Flexible content-to-modality mapping

#### UI/UX Changes
- Homepage cards show: modality + content type + title + description
- Color coding by modality (not content type)
- Navigation to individual content pieces (not content type pages)

#### Test Architecture Updates
- Test IDs changed from framework-based to content-based
- New data attributes for pathway testing
- Updated accessibility labels

### Risk Assessment & Mitigation

#### High Risk: Editorial Overwhelm
- **Mitigation**: Start with monthly curation, measure time investment
- **Fallback**: Implement algorithmic selection based on recency

#### Medium Risk: User Confusion
- **Mitigation**: User testing before launch
- **Fallback**: Add explanatory text or revert to simpler structure

#### Low Risk: Technical Complexity
- **Mitigation**: Build minimal feature set first
- **Fallback**: Well-documented rollback procedures

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Three distinct pathways display successfully
- [ ] Users navigate from pathways to content successfully
- [ ] Content appears appropriately in multiple modality contexts
- [ ] Editorial workflow remains manageable (< 30min weekly)
- [ ] Page performance maintained (< 3s load time)

### Approval Chain
- **Proposed**: 2025-09-24
- **Technical Review**: 2025-09-24 ✓
- **Content Strategy Review**: 2025-09-24 ✓
- **Final Approval**: 2025-09-24 ✓

### Next Steps
1. Update constitution to reflect content-first with modality enhancement principles
2. Begin Phase 1 technical implementation
3. Develop content migration strategy
4. Plan user testing for validation

## Decision: Preserve THINKING-FEELING-DOING Framework
**Date**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: CONFIRMED
**Context**: Initial consideration to eliminate framework entirely

### Original Proposal
Remove THINKING-FEELING-DOING references and use content types (Publications/Artworks/Musings) as direct navigation doorways.

### Analysis Results
- Framework is deeply embedded in 47+ files across specifications, tests, and implementation
- Color system semantically tied to modalities
- Framework represents core philosophical foundation of MQ Studio
- Removal would eliminate key differentiator and conceptual coherence

### Decision
**REJECTED** - Framework is fundamental to MQ Studio's identity and should be preserved while addressing the mapping contradictions through architectural improvement rather than elimination.

### Alternative Selected
Integrated Pathways approach (see above) that preserves framework while eliminating reductive content mapping.

## Decision: YAML Content Validation Strategy
**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: RECOMMENDED
**Decision Maker**: Development Team
**Context**: YAML parsing error caused HTTP 500 site-wide failure

### Problem
Content markdown files use YAML frontmatter for metadata. Journal names, book titles, and other string values containing special characters (especially colons) can break YAML parsing if not properly quoted, causing application-wide failures.

**Incident:** File `content/publications/creative-governance-public-engagement.md` contained:
```yaml
journal: Environment and Planning C: Politics and Space
```
The unquoted colon broke YAML parser, causing HTTP 500 on all pages.

### Impact Assessment
- **Severity:** Critical - Complete site failure
- **Detection Time:** Unknown (discovered in testing)
- **Resolution Time:** 5 minutes once identified
- **Blast Radius:** Entire application (content service initialization fails)

### Considered Options

#### Option 1: Manual Review (CURRENT)
- **Description:** Rely on developers to remember quoting rules
- **Pros:** No tooling needed, zero cost
- **Cons:** Error-prone, no prevention, reactive only
- **Risk:** HIGH - Human error inevitable

#### Option 2: YAML Linting in CI/CD (RECOMMENDED)
- **Description:** Add yamllint or similar to pre-commit hooks and CI pipeline
- **Pros:** Catches errors before deployment, low cost, automated
- **Cons:** Adds build step, requires configuration
- **Risk:** LOW - Prevents errors proactively

#### Option 3: Runtime Validation with Fallbacks
- **Description:** Catch YAML errors during content service initialization, log and skip invalid files
- **Pros:** Graceful degradation, no site-wide failure
- **Cons:** Silent failures possible, content may disappear without notice
- **Risk:** MEDIUM - Better than current but masks problems

#### Option 4: JSON Schema Validation
- **Description:** Define strict schema for content frontmatter, validate against schema
- **Pros:** Comprehensive validation, catches structural issues too
- **Cons:** Higher complexity, maintenance burden
- **Risk:** LOW - Most robust but highest cost

### Recommendation: Multi-Layered Approach

**Tier 1: Content Author Guidelines (Immediate)**
- Document YAML quoting rules in content authoring guide
- List special characters requiring quotes: `: { } [ ] , & * # ? | - < > = ! % @ \``
- Provide examples of correct frontmatter

**Tier 2: Pre-Commit Validation (Short-term)**
```bash
# Add to .husky/pre-commit or similar
yamllint content/**/*.md --config-file .yamllint.yml
```

**Tier 3: CI/CD Validation (Short-term)**
```yaml
# Add to GitHub Actions or similar
- name: Validate Content YAML
  run: |
    npm run validate:content
    # Script checks all frontmatter parses correctly
```

**Tier 4: Runtime Graceful Degradation (Medium-term)**
```typescript
// In content-service.ts
try {
  const parsed = matter(fileContent);
} catch (error) {
  logger.error(`Invalid YAML in ${filePath}:`, error);
  // Skip file, continue loading others
  // Alert via monitoring system
}
```

### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Documentation (Completed)**
- ✅ Document incident in SESSION_HISTORY.md
- ✅ Add to ISSUES_TRACKER.md as resolved issue
- [ ] Create CONTENT_AUTHORING_GUIDELINES.md

**Phase 2: Validation Tooling (Next Session)**
- [ ] Add yamllint dependency
- [ ] Configure .yamllint.yml
- [ ] Add validation script to package.json
- [ ] Test on existing content

**Phase 3: Automation (Future)**
- [ ] Add pre-commit hook
- [ ] Add CI/CD validation step
- [ ] Set up monitoring/alerting

**Phase 4: Resilience (Future)**
- [ ] Add runtime error handling
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation
- [ ] Add content health dashboard

### Technical Implications

**Dependencies:**
- `yamllint` (Python) or `yaml-lint` (Node.js)
- Pre-commit hook framework (husky or similar)

**Files to Modify:**
- `package.json` - Add validation script
- `.github/workflows/` - Add CI validation
- `.husky/pre-commit` - Add validation hook
- `lib/content/content-service.ts` - Add error handling

**Testing Strategy:**
- Create test files with various YAML errors
- Verify linter catches all error types
- Test CI/CD pipeline with failing content
- Verify runtime fallbacks work correctly

### Success Criteria
- [ ] No YAML syntax errors reach production
- [ ] Invalid content files logged and skipped gracefully
- [ ] Content authors have clear guidelines
- [ ] CI/CD catches errors before merge
- [ ] Monitoring alerts on content validation failures

### Risk Mitigation

**Risk: False Positives from Linter**
- **Mitigation:** Configure linter to match project style
- **Fallback:** Allow override for specific files if needed

**Risk: Build Time Increase**
- **Mitigation:** Run validation in parallel with other checks
- **Fallback:** Make validation non-blocking initially (warnings only)

**Risk: Developer Friction**
- **Mitigation:** Make validation fast and clear about errors
- **Fallback:** Provide auto-fix suggestions where possible

## Decision: Meta-Orchestrator Agent Discipline Framework
**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: APPROVED - Mandatory for All Future Sessions
**Decision Maker**: User Directive
**Context**: Session #004 revealed suboptimal agent usage (20% vs optimal 60-70%)

### Problem
During Session #004, the orchestrator performed work directly instead of delegating to agents, violating the meta-orchestrator framework principles:
- Test optimization work (~20k tokens) done directly instead of via agents
- Sequential execution used instead of parallel agents
- Only 20% agent usage vs optimal 60-70%
- Token savings missed: ~15-20k tokens

**Framework violation:** "Task >5k tokens → Spawn agent (79% token savings)"

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Momentum bias:** After achieving test success, continued implementing in "flow state"
2. **Task granularity misjudgment:** Individual test fixes felt small (~5 lines) but collectively were 20k tokens
3. **Role confusion:** Shifted from orchestrator to implementer
4. **Missing triggers:** No systematic checkpoint to evaluate agent delegation

### Impact Assessment
- **Token Efficiency:** Lost 15-20k tokens (35-40% of session)
- **Parallelization:** Sequential execution when 3+ tasks could run parallel
- **Scalability:** Pattern doesn't scale for larger tasks
- **Framework Compliance:** Violated meta-orchestrator principles

### Approved Solution: Systematic Agent Discipline System

#### 1. Pre-Task Checklist (MANDATORY)
Before ANY implementation work, orchestrator MUST evaluate:

```yaml
Agent Delegation Decision Tree:
  Task >5k tokens?
    → YES: MUST spawn agent
    → NO: Continue to next check

  Multiple independent tasks?
    → YES: MUST spawn parallel agents (ONE message, multiple Task calls)
    → NO: Continue to next check

  Task involves substantial file operations/reading/writing?
    → YES: SHOULD spawn agent (better context management)
    → NO: May implement directly

  Combined work >10k tokens?
    → YES: MUST spawn coordinating agent
    → NO: Acceptable to implement directly
```

#### 2. Agent Usage Tracking (MANDATORY)

**Add to EVERY orchestrator response:**
```yaml
[Agent Usage Check]
Session total tokens: X
Direct implementation: Y tokens (Z%)
Agent delegation: A tokens (B%)
Agent usage rate: C% (Target: >60%)
Status: GREEN >60% | AMBER 40-60% | RED <40%
Action: [Continue | Increase delegation]
```

#### 3. Parallel Execution Protocol (MANDATORY)

**When 2+ independent tasks exist:**
```typescript
// CORRECT: One message, multiple agents in parallel
Task 1: Fix timeout issues
Task 2: Fix search navigation
Task 3: Update documentation
// All in SINGLE message with 3 Task tool calls

// INCORRECT: Sequential spawning
Task 1 → wait → Task 2 → wait → Task 3
```

#### 4. Role Boundaries (MANDATORY)

**Orchestrator Role:**
- ✅ Analyze requirements
- ✅ Break down tasks
- ✅ Spawn agents with clear instructions
- ✅ Synthesize agent results
- ✅ Make strategic decisions
- ✅ Track token usage
- ✅ Coordinate parallel work

**Agent Role:**
- ✅ Implement solutions
- ✅ Read/write files
- ✅ Execute substantial work
- ✅ Report back with results

**Orchestrator MUST NOT:**
- ❌ Implement solutions directly (if >5k tokens)
- ❌ Read/write multiple files sequentially
- ❌ Do work that could be parallelized
- ❌ Execute without agent usage evaluation

### Implementation: Embedded Checks

#### Check 1: Session Start
```yaml
[Session Start Protocol]
1. Read meta-orchestrator framework
2. Identify all tasks in user request
3. Estimate token size per task
4. Create agent delegation plan
5. Execute plan with agents
```

#### Check 2: Before Each Task
```yaml
[Pre-Task Protocol]
Before ANY implementation:
1. Estimate token cost
2. Check delegation criteria
3. If agent needed: spawn agent
4. If parallel possible: spawn multiple
5. Track agent usage rate
```

#### Check 3: Mid-Session (Every 30k tokens)
```yaml
[Mid-Session Protocol]
At 30k, 60k, 90k token marks:
1. Check agent usage rate
2. If <60%: STOP and evaluate
3. Identify missed delegation opportunities
4. Adjust approach for remaining work
```

#### Check 4: Session End
```yaml
[Session End Protocol]
1. Calculate final agent usage rate
2. Document lessons learned
3. Update SESSION_HISTORY.md
4. Note delegation patterns (good/bad)
```

### Enforcement Mechanisms

#### Mechanism 1: Pre-Task Blockers
Orchestrator MUST answer before implementing:
1. "What is the token estimate?"
2. "Should this use an agent?"
3. "Can this be parallelized?"
4. "What's my current agent usage rate?"

#### Mechanism 2: Self-Correction Triggers
If orchestrator catches self implementing >5k token task:
1. STOP immediately
2. Acknowledge the deviation
3. Reframe as agent task
4. Spawn appropriate agent(s)

#### Mechanism 3: Documentation Requirements
Every session MUST include in SESSION_HISTORY.md:
- Agent usage rate (actual vs target)
- Delegation decisions (with rationale)
- Missed opportunities identified
- Improvements for next session

### Success Metrics

**Per Session:**
- Agent usage rate >60% (target: 70%)
- Parallel execution when 2+ independent tasks exist
- All >5k token tasks delegated
- Token savings >50% vs direct implementation

**Per Project:**
- Consistent >60% agent usage across sessions
- No regression to direct implementation patterns
- Documented delegation patterns in session history
- Clear agent usage trends improving over time

### Technical Implementation

#### Created Documents:
1. **AGENT_DELEGATION_CHECKLIST.md** - Quick reference for every task
2. **SESSION_HISTORY.md update** - Add agent usage tracking section
3. **IMPLEMENTATION_DECISIONS_LOG.md** - This decision
4. **AGENT_COORDINATION_TEMPLATE.md** - Template for parallel agent spawning

#### Modified Workflows:
- Session start: Read meta-orchestrator framework + checklist
- Pre-task: Run delegation decision tree
- Mid-task: Track agent usage rate
- Session end: Document agent usage patterns

### Examples

#### Example 1: Test Optimization (What Should Have Been Done)
```yaml
Task: Fix 3 failing tests + update docs
Estimate: 20k tokens total

Correct Approach:
  Message 1: Spawn 4 agents in parallel
    - Agent 1: Fix timeout test (responsive-design.spec.js)
    - Agent 2: Fix search navigation (search-functionality.spec.js)
    - Agent 3: Fix results grouping (search-functionality.spec.js)
    - Agent 4: Update documentation (ISSUES_TRACKER.md)

  Orchestrator: Synthesize results, verify integration

  Result: 20k work → 5k orchestration = 75% savings
```

#### Example 2: Content Migration (What Was Done Correctly)
```yaml
Task: Migrate 50+ assets to content structure
Estimate: 15k tokens

Correct Approach:
  Agent 1: Sample migration (10 items)
  Orchestrator: Review sample
  Agents 2-5: Full migration in parallel (if approved)
    - Agent 2: Watercolors (30 items)
    - Agent 3: Landscape designs (6 items)
    - Agent 4: Publications (3 items)
    - Agent 5: Image optimization

  Result: 40-50k work → 10k orchestration = 75-80% savings
```

### Risk Mitigation

**Risk: Over-delegation (too many small agents)**
- Mitigation: 5k token minimum threshold
- Fallback: Batch small tasks into single agent

**Risk: Parallelization complexity**
- Mitigation: Clear agent instructions with no interdependencies
- Fallback: Sequential agents if dependencies exist

**Risk: Agent coordination overhead**
- Mitigation: Use general-purpose agents, avoid specialized agent proliferation
- Fallback: Consolidate into fewer agents if coordination burden high

- [ ] Agent usage rate calculated and documented
- [ ] Delegation decisions logged with rationale
- [ ] Missed opportunities identified
- [ ] Improvements noted for next session
- [ ] SESSION_HISTORY.md updated with agent usage section
