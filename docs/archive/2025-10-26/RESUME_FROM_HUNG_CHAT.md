## Critical Issues Identified (Needs Immediate Attention)

### Issue 1: HTTP 500 Internal Server Error (CRITICAL)

**Status:** ❌ Blocking all testing
**Impact:** Application cannot serve pages properly
**Evidence:**
- Test report shows "Internal Server Error" on most page loads
- Screenshots captured during tests show error page
- Prevents testing of search functionality

**Likely Causes:**
1. Server-side rendering error
2. Database connection issue
3. Missing environment variables
4. Content loading error
5. API route misconfiguration

**Next Steps:**
1. Check application logs for detailed error stack trace
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Test database connectivity
4. Review recent code changes that might have broken SSR

### Issue 2: Search Functionality Not Working (HIGH)

**Status:** ❌ Cannot test due to server errors
**Expected Behavior:**
- Homepage should show search bar
- Typing should trigger autocomplete
- Search should navigate to `/search?q=query`
- Results should be grouped by content type (Publications, Artworks, Musings, Projects)
- Results should be relevant to query

**Actual Behavior:**
- Cannot access pages due to HTTP 500
- Search functionality untested

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix server errors first
2. Then verify search implementation exists
3. Test search with various queries
4. Verify search index is built properly

### Issue 3: Test Infrastructure Reliability (MEDIUM)

**Status:** ⚠️ Tests timing out frequently
**Issues:**
- Multiple timeouts during test execution
- Inconsistent test results
- Long test duration (5.6 min for 11 tests)

**Next Steps:**
1. Increase test timeouts for slow-loading pages
2. Add better error handling in tests
3. Implement retry logic for flaky operations
4. Optimize page load times

---

## Application Architecture

**Framework:** Astro (SSR mode)
**Runtime:** Node.js
**Port:** http://localhost:3100

**Key Directories:**
- `content/` - Markdown content (publications, projects, musings, artworks)
- `src/pages/` - Astro pages and routes
- `src/components/` - React/Astro components
- `tests/playwright/` - E2E tests
- `public/` - Static assets

**Environment:**
- Development server: `npm run dev`
- Production build: `npm run build`
- Preview: `npm run preview`

---

## Commands to Check Current State

### 1. Check if Dev Server is Running

```bash
ps aux | grep "npm run dev\|node.*astro" | grep -v grep
```

**Expected:** Should see a running process
**If not running:** Start with `npm run dev`

### 2. Check Application Logs

```bash
# If dev server is running, check its console output
# Look for error stack traces
```

### 3. Test Application is Accessible

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:3100
```

**Expected:** HTTP 200 OK
**Current:** Likely HTTP 500 Internal Server Error

### 4. Check Environment Variables

```bash
cat .env
# or
cat .env.local
```

**Verify:** All required variables are set

### 5. Check Content Files

```bash
ls -R content/
```

**Verify:** All markdown files exist and are properly formatted

---

## Debugging Strategy

### Step 1: Fix HTTP 500 Errors

**Priority:** CRITICAL - Nothing else works until this is fixed

**Approach:**
1. Check dev server console for error stack trace
2. Look for SSR errors in server-side rendering
3. Verify all content files parse correctly
4. Check if any API routes are failing
5. Verify environment configuration

**Commands:**
```bash
# Restart dev server with verbose logging
npm run dev

# Or check build output
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Verify Search Functionality

**Priority:** HIGH - Core feature

**Approach:**
1. Check if `/search` route exists
2. Verify search component implementation
3. Test search API endpoint (if separate)
4. Verify search index generation
5. Test autocomplete functionality

**Files to Check:**
- `src/pages/search.astro` or similar
- `src/components/Search*.tsx` or similar
- Search data/index files

### Step 3: Run Tests Again

**Priority:** MEDIUM - After fixes are implemented

**Approach:**
```bash
# Run full test suite
npm run test:e2e

# Or run specific test
npm run test:e2e -- search.spec.ts

# Or run in UI mode for debugging
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

## Where Previous Chat Likely Got Stuck

**Hypothesis:** The previous chat thread likely:

1. **Started testing** - Ran Playwright tests
2. **Found HTTP 500 errors** - Discovered server issues
3. **Began debugging** - Tried to investigate root cause
4. **Got into loop** - Possibly repeatedly checking logs or trying fixes
5. **Ran out of tokens** - Chat became unresponsive due to token exhaustion

**Evidence:**
- Test report shows failures
- No fix implementation files created
- Server issues remain unresolved

---

## Recommended Next Steps for New Chat

### Immediate Actions (15-30 minutes)

1. **Diagnose HTTP 500 error:**
   ```
   User: "Check the dev server logs and identify why the application
   is returning HTTP 500 errors. Start by checking if the server is
   running and review any error stack traces."
   ```

2. **Fix root cause:**
   ```
   User: "Based on the error you found, fix the HTTP 500 issue.
   This might involve fixing content parsing, environment variables,
   or server configuration."
   ```

3. **Verify application loads:**
   ```
   User: "Test that http://localhost:3100 now loads successfully.
   Take a screenshot using Playwright MCP if available."
   ```

### Secondary Actions (30-60 minutes)

4. **Test search functionality:**
   ```
   User: "Now that the app loads, verify that search functionality
   works. Test:
   - Homepage shows search bar
   - Typing triggers autocomplete
   - Search navigates to results page
   - Results are relevant and grouped by type"
   ```

5. **Re-run Playwright tests:**
   ```
   User: "Run the Playwright search tests again and verify they
   pass now that the server is working."
   ```

6. **Address remaining test failures:**
   ```
   User: "Fix any remaining test failures one by one. Start with
   the most critical: results grouping by content type."
   ```

## Technical Notes

### Playwright MCP Usage

If available, Claude Code can autonomously:
```
"Take a screenshot of http://localhost:3100 to verify the homepage loads"
"Check the search functionality by navigating to the search page"
"Test mobile responsive layout at 375px width"
```

### Browser Vision Tools

Three tools available for autonomous use:
1. Playwright MCP (screenshots, navigation)
2. Chrome DevTools MCP (console inspection, debugging)
3. Browser Use (full automation)

See [`.claude/browser-vision-integration.md`](.claude/browser-vision-integration.md) for details.
