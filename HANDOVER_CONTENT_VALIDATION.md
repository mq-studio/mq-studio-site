## 1. Validation Approach

### Testing Strategy (IDP Framework Compliant)

#### Phase 1: Simulated Testing ‚úÖ (Already Done)
- File structure validation
- Markdown syntax validation
- Image file existence checks
- Frontmatter schema compliance

#### Phase 2: Real-Life Testing ‚è≥ (Current Phase)
**Why Human Required:**
- Visual assessment of image quality
- Subjective evaluation of AI-generated descriptions
- Responsive design validation across viewports
- Interaction testing (clicks, navigation, filtering)
- Browser console error detection

**Cannot be automated because:**
- Requires subjective design judgment
- Need to assess "good enough" for AI descriptions
- Visual regression baseline doesn't exist yet
- First-time content migration (no comparison data)

#### Phase 3: Automated Testing üîÆ (Future Phase)
**After approval, can implement:**
- Screenshot comparison tests (Playwright)
- Automated responsive design checks
- Broken link detection
- Image optimization validation
- Performance benchmarking

### Validation Methodology
1. **Systematic:** Follow checklist line-by-line
2. **Documented:** Record every issue found
3. **Categorized:** Use severity levels (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
4. **Actionable:** Provide specific fix recommendations
5. **Evidence-Based:** Capture screenshots of issues

#### Automated Screenshot Capture ‚úÖ
**Agent Capability:** High
**Tools:** Playwright via bash_tool
**Use for:**
- Capturing gallery views at different viewports
- Documenting issues with screenshots
- Creating before/after comparison images

**Example delegation:**
```
Agent: "Capture screenshots of artworks gallery at mobile (375px),
tablet (768px), and desktop (1920px) viewports"
```

#### Console Error Detection ‚úÖ
**Agent Capability:** High
**Tools:** Playwright console listener

- Validating image path references

### What Needs Human Testing ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### Visual Quality Assessment üë§ Human Required
**Why:** Subjective design judgment needed
- Image quality and appearance
- Color accuracy and vibrancy
- Layout aesthetic appeal
- Typography readability

#### Description Quality Review üë§ Human Required
**Why:** Contextual understanding needed
- AI-generated descriptions accuracy
- Tone and voice alignment
- Cultural sensitivity (especially Chinese calligraphy)
- Personal/historical context only owner knows

#### Feature Prioritization üë§ Human Required
**Why:** Business decision needed
- Which items should be "featured"
- Content categorization decisions
- Navigation structure preferences

#### Final Approval Decision üë§ Human Required
**Why:** Stakeholder sign-off needed
- Overall satisfaction with migration approach
- Approval to proceed with full migration
- Budget allocation for next phase

### Hybrid Approach (Human + Agent)

**Recommended workflow:**
1. Agent captures screenshots at all viewports
2. Human reviews screenshots for visual issues
3. Agent checks console for technical errors
4. Human validates content quality and descriptions
5. Agent documents findings in checklist
6. Human makes final approval decision

## 5. Expected Issues

Based on migration process and common patterns, expect these issues:

### High Probability Issues

#### Image Path Problems üî¥ Critical
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Symptoms:**
- Broken image icons
- Alt text displayed instead of images
- 404 errors in console

**Causes:**
- Incorrect path in markdown frontmatter
- File extension mismatch (.jpg vs .jpeg)
- Case sensitivity issues

**How to diagnose:**
- Check browser console for 404s
- Compare image path in markdown to actual file location
- Verify public/ prefix usage

**Fix approach:**
```bash
# Verify image paths in content files
grep -r "image:" content/ | grep -v "^#"

# Check actual image files exist
ls -la public/images/artworks/
ls -la public/images/projects/
ls -la public/images/publications/
```

#### AI Description Quality üü° Medium
**Likelihood:** High
**Symptoms:**
- Generic, uninspired descriptions
- Factual inaccuracies
- Cultural misinterpretation (calligraphy)
- Overly verbose or flowery language

**Causes:**
- AI generated without human context
- No personal insight or backstory
- Limited visual analysis

**How to diagnose:**
- Read each description critically
- Look for `[AI GENERATED - PLACEHOLDER]` tags
- Check for obvious errors or assumptions

**Fix approach:**
- Document which descriptions need rewriting
- Prioritize by importance (featured items first)
- Note specific issues to guide rewrite

#### Date Information Missing üü¢ Low
**Likelihood:** Very High (8 of 9 items)
**Symptoms:**
- "Date unknown" shown in metadata
- Timeline sorting may be inaccurate

**Causes:**
- Filenames didn't contain dates
- No metadata in original files

**How to diagnose:**
- Check frontmatter `date:` field
- Count items marked "date unknown"

**Fix approach:**
- User needs to provide dates from memory/records
- Can estimate based on style/context
- Lower priority (doesn't block approval)

### Medium Probability Issues

#### Dual Entry Consistency üü° Medium
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Symptoms:**
- Same item appears differently in artworks vs projects
- Image doesn't match between entries
- Description not appropriate for context

**Causes:**
- Manual creation of dual entries
- Copy-paste errors
- Different context requirements

**How to diagnose:**
- Compare university-excellence-sketch in both galleries
- Compare northgate-concept in both galleries
- Check image URLs match
- Verify descriptions make sense in each context

#### Featured Item Selection üü° Medium
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Symptoms:**
- Featured items not user's preference
- Homepage displays wrong items
- Important works not highlighted

**Causes:**
- Agent made assumptions about featured status
- Used visual quality as proxy for importance
- No user guidance on preferences

**How to diagnose:**
- Check which items show on homepage
- Review featured: true/false in frontmatter
- Assess if selections align with user's priorities

### Low Probability Issues

#### Responsive Layout Issues üü¢ Low
**Likelihood:** Low (framework handles this)
**Symptoms:**
- Layout breaks at certain viewports
- Images overflow containers
- Text truncated or overlapping

**Causes:**
- CSS framework issues
- Custom styles conflicting
- Image aspect ratio edge cases

#### Search Not Finding Items üü¢ Low
**Likelihood:** Low
**Symptoms:**
- Expected search terms don't return results
- Items with matching tags not found

**Causes:**
- Search indexing issue
- Tag format inconsistency

   - Opus better at contextual reasoning
   - Quality assessment requires deeper analysis

3. **Documentation Quality**
   - Need clear, well-written issue reports
   - Opus produces more polished documentation
   - User-facing communication is critical

4. **Token Budget Not Critical**
   - Validation primarily human-driven (browser testing)
   - Agent does documentation/screenshots
   - ~5-10k tokens estimated (well within budget)

5. **Decision Support**
   - Final approval recommendation is complex
   - Needs to weigh multiple factors
   - Opus provides better strategic thinking

#### When Sonnet 4.5 Would Be Better

Use Sonnet 4.5 for the **next phase** (full migration):
- High-volume repetitive tasks (50+ items)
- Clear template-based work
- Cost optimization important
- Parallel agent deployment
- Speed over nuance

### Token Budget Expectation

**Validation Phase (Current):**
- Orchestrator planning: ~2k tokens

## 10. Troubleshooting Guide

### Dev Server Won't Start

**Symptom:** `npm run dev` fails or errors

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version  # Should be v20.x

# Check for port conflict
lsof -i :3100  # Should be empty or show node process

# Check dependencies
ls -la node_modules/  # Should exist with many packages
```

**Fixes:**
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Try different port
npm run dev -- --port 3101

# Check for errors in package.json
cat package.json | grep "dev"
```

### Images Not Loading

**Symptom:** Broken image icons or alt text

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check image files exist
ls -la public/images/artworks/
ls -la public/images/projects/
ls -la public/images/publications/

# Check image paths in content
grep -r "image:" content/artworks/
grep -r "image:" content/projects/
grep -r "image:" content/publications/
```

**Common causes:**
- Path missing /images/ prefix
- File extension wrong (.jpg vs .jpeg)
- Case sensitivity (Linux is case-sensitive)
- Image in wrong category folder

**Fixes:**
- Update markdown frontmatter image path
- Rename file to match reference
- Move image to correct folder

### Gallery Page Empty

**Symptom:** Gallery shows "No items found" or is blank

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check content files exist
ls -la content/artworks/
ls -la content/projects/
ls -la content/publications/

# Check frontmatter syntax
head -20 content/artworks/cherry-blossoms-painting.md
```

**Common causes:**
- Frontmatter syntax error (YAML)
- Missing required fields
- File not in correct directory
- File doesn't have .md extension

**Fixes:**
- Validate YAML syntax
- Check required fields present
- Ensure file in correct content/ subdirectory

### Console Errors

**Symptom:** Red errors in browser console (F12)

**Diagnosis:**
- Open browser DevTools (F12)
- Switch to Console tab
- Look for error messages
- Note file paths and line numbers

**Common errors:**
- 404 Not Found: File path wrong
- JavaScript error: Code issue (less likely)
- Network error: Server issue
- CORS error: Resource loading issue

**Fixes:**
- For 404s: Verify file paths
- For JS errors: Check console for details
- For network: Restart dev server
- For CORS: Usually not an issue in dev

### Responsive Layout Broken

**Symptom:** Layout doesn't adapt to viewport size

**Diagnosis:**
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Switch to responsive design mode
- Test viewports: 375px, 768px, 1920px
- Check for horizontal scrolling

**Common causes:**
- CSS framework issue
- Fixed widths in custom styles
- Images too large
- Content overflow

**Fixes:**
- Usually handled by framework
- Check for custom CSS overrides
- Ensure max-width on images
- Report to user if persistent

  // Listen for console messages
  page.on("console", msg => console.log("CONSOLE:", msg.text()));

  // Listen for errors
  page.on("pageerror", err => console.log("ERROR:", err.message));

  await page.goto("http://localhost:3100/gallery/artworks");
  await page.waitForTimeout(2000);
  await browser.close();
})();'
```

#### Network Request Monitoring
```bash
node -e 'const { chromium } = require("@playwright/test");
(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
