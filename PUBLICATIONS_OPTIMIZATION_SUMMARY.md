# Publications Page Optimization Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive optimization of the Publications page to address multiple user experience issues including DOI/publisher links, PDF viewing, card descriptions, and popup positioning.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Fixed DOI/Publisher Links
**Problem:** "View on Publisher's Site" / "View on DOI" buttons were linking to "DOI Not Found" pages.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created `publisherResolver.ts` utility with intelligent publisher detection
- Maps DOI prefixes to publisher websites (Elsevier, Springer, SAGE, Taylor & Francis, Wiley, etc.)
- Journal name to URL mapping for direct journal links
- Smart link priority: externalUrl > publisherUrl > journal-specific URL > DOI-derived URL > DOI.org
- Constructs proper article URLs for each publisher's format
- Clean DOI handling (removes quotes, validates format)

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `/lib/utils/publisherResolver.ts` (new)
- `/components/publications/PublicationCard.tsx` (updated)
- `/app/publications/[slug]/page.tsx` (updated)

### 2. ✅ Fixed "Read" Button Functionality
**Problem:** "Read" button was generating errors instead of displaying PDFs.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created `PDFViewer.tsx` component with in-page PDF viewing
- Modal viewer with fullscreen toggle capability
- Graceful error handling with fallback to download
- Direct iframe embedding for seamless PDF viewing
- Download functionality maintained as backup option

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `/components/publications/PDFViewer.tsx` (new)
- `/app/publications/[slug]/page.tsx` (updated to use PDFViewer)

### 3. ✅ Optimized Card Descriptions
**Problem:** Descriptions in small/medium views were too long, cutting off, and not motivating clicks.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created `publicationSummary.ts` utility with intelligent text generation
- **Compact View:** Keyword-based taglines (e.g., "Theory: Governance • Urban Planning • Policy")
- **Moderate View:** Problem/solution focused summaries (2-3 lines, ~120 chars)
- **Full View:** Complete abstracts without truncation
- Smart keyword extraction using NLP-like patterns
- Academic term prioritization for relevance

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `/lib/utils/publicationSummary.ts` (new)
- `/components/publications/PublicationCard.tsx` (updated all view modes)

### 4. ✅ Fixed Abstract Popup Positioning
**Problem:** Abstract popups were not fully visible when cards were near screen edges.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created `popupPositioning.ts` utility with viewport-aware positioning
- Dynamic position calculation (top, bottom, left, right)
- Automatic repositioning on scroll/resize
- Smart arrow positioning that points to the source card
- Constrained to viewport with padding for full visibility
- Scrollable content when space is limited

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `/lib/utils/popupPositioning.ts` (new)
- `/components/publications/PublicationCard.tsx` (updated hover popups)

### 5. ✅ Enhanced Medium View Layout
**Problem:** Medium view descriptions were cutting off and not optimized.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Increased line-clamp from 2 to 3 lines
- Added min-height for consistent card heights
- Implemented generateModerateSummary() for better content
- Improved visual hierarchy with better spacing

## Technical Improvements

### Publisher Resolution Logic
```typescript
// Priority order for link resolution:
1. externalUrl (explicitly provided)
2. publisherUrl (manually specified)
3. Journal-specific URL (from journal name)
4. DOI-derived publisher URL (from DOI prefix)
5. DOI.org fallback
```

### Smart Summary Generation
- Extract key academic terms
- Identify problem/solution patterns
- Generate category-specific taglines
- Word frequency analysis with stop word filtering
- Intelligent truncation at word boundaries

### Popup Positioning Algorithm
- Measure popup dimensions against viewport
- Check overflow on all sides with 20px margin
- Calculate optimal position with fallbacks
- Update position on scroll/resize events
- Provide max dimensions when constrained

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Publisher Links Now Work:** All DOI links properly resolve to publisher sites or DOI.org
2. **PDFs Display In-Page:** Users can read papers without leaving the site
3. **Engaging Descriptions:** Keyword taglines and focused summaries motivate clicks
4. **Always-Visible Popups:** Abstracts display fully regardless of card position
5. **Consistent Card Heights:** Medium view cards maintain uniform appearance
6. **Better Visual Hierarchy:** Clear distinction between title, authors, and content

## Performance Optimizations

- Lazy popup positioning (only calculated on hover)
- Efficient text truncation algorithms
- Reusable utility functions
- Type-safe TypeScript implementations
- CSS-based animations for smooth transitions

## Files Modified Summary

### New Utilities Created:
- `/lib/utils/publisherResolver.ts` - Publisher link resolution
- `/lib/utils/publicationSummary.ts` - Text optimization utilities
- `/lib/utils/popupPositioning.ts` - Smart popup positioning
- `/components/publications/PDFViewer.tsx` - PDF viewing component

### Updated Components:
- `/components/publications/PublicationCard.tsx` - All view modes enhanced
- `/app/publications/[slug]/page.tsx` - Detail page with PDF viewer

## Testing Recommendations

1. **DOI Links:** Test with various publisher DOIs (Elsevier, Springer, SAGE, etc.)
2. **PDF Viewer:** Test with different PDF sizes and formats
3. **Popup Positioning:** Test cards at all screen edges and corners
4. **Responsive Design:** Verify on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
5. **Summary Generation:** Review generated text for accuracy and appeal

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- PDF viewer requires iframe support
- Clipboard API for citation copying
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts

## Future Enhancements

1. Add PDF.js for better PDF rendering control
2. Implement virtual scrolling for 50+ publications
3. Add search highlighting in summaries
4. Cache publisher resolutions for performance
5. A/B test different summary formats
