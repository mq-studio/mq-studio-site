## ✅ What We Fixed

### 1. Homepage Mobile Timeout (responsive-design.spec.js)
**Problem:** Test timeout at 30s during screenshot operations
**Solution:** Increased test timeout to 60s
**Code Change:**
```javascript
// Line 68 in tests/playwright/responsive-design.spec.js
test.setTimeout(60000); // Mobile viewport needs extra time
```
**Result:** ✅ Test now passes consistently

---

### 2. Search Navigation Tests (search-functionality.spec.js)
**Problem:** Next.js client-side routing not detected by `waitForLoadState`
**Solution:** Added `page.waitForURL()` with regex pattern
**Code Change:**
```javascript
// Line 101 in tests/playwright/search-functionality.spec.js
await page.waitForURL(/\/(search|\?q=|query=|s=)/, { timeout: 5000 }).catch(() => {});
```
**Result:** ✅ URL navigation test now passes

---

### 3. Search Results Grouping Test (search-functionality.spec.js)
**Problem:** Test checking for type headings before results loaded
**Solution:** Added wait for search results to render
**Code Change:**
```javascript
// Line 129 in tests/playwright/search-functionality.spec.js
await page.waitForSelector('h2, p:has-text("No results found")', { timeout: 10000 }).catch(() => {});
await page.waitForTimeout(1000); // Extra time for results to render
```
**Result:** ✅ Found all 4 content type groups (Publications, Artworks, Musings, Projects)

---

## 📈 Overall Progress (All Sessions)

### From Session #002 to Session #004

## 📁 Files Modified (Session #004)

1. `tests/playwright/responsive-design.spec.js` - Added test.setTimeout(60000) at line 68
2. `tests/playwright/search-functionality.spec.js` - Added page.waitForURL() at line 101, waitForSelector at line 129
3. `docs/ISSUES_TRACKER.md` - Updated all issues to resolved status
4. `SESSION_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md` - Updated with Session #004 results

## 🎓 Key Lessons

1. **Test timeouts matter at multiple levels:**
   - Page navigation timeout (30s) - controls goto operations
   - Test timeout (60s) - controls entire test including screenshots

2. **Next.js client routing needs special handling:**
   - `page.waitForLoadState()` doesn't detect client-side navigation
   - Use `page.waitForURL()` with regex patterns instead

3. **Async content needs proper waits:**
   - Wait for specific content to appear, not just page load
   - Use `page.waitForSelector()` for dynamic content

4. **Playwright best practices:**
   - Always wait for state changes before assertions
   - Use `.catch(() => {})` for optional waits
   - Add small buffer times for rendering (e.g., 1000ms)

## 🚀 Next Steps Recommendations

### Option 1: Content Development (Recommended)
Now that tests are 100% passing, focus on:
- Adding more publications
- Creating artworks gallery
- Writing musings
- Building project showcases

### Option 2: Feature Development
With stable foundation, add:
- Advanced search filters
- Content tagging system
- Social sharing
- Analytics

### Option 3: Performance Optimization
Already fast, but could:
- Implement image optimization
- Add caching strategies
- Optimize bundle size
- Server-side generate static pages
