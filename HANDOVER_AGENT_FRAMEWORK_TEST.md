# Agent Discipline Framework Testing - Handover Document

**Status:** Ready for Testing
**Created:** 2025-10-26
**Purpose:** Test the agent discipline framework in real-world conditions to prove it works
**Target:** New Meta-Orchestrator Agent

---

## Executive Summary

### What This Is About

In Session #004, we created a comprehensive agent discipline framework to ensure meta-orchestrators properly delegate work to agents instead of implementing directly. The framework aims for **>60% agent usage** vs the problematic 20% we observed.

**The Problem:**
- Session #004 achieved only 20% agent usage (should be 60-70%)
- Work that should have used 4 parallel agents was done directly
- Lost ~15-20k tokens (~35-40% of work)
- Framework was created but NOT yet tested with real work

**What You Need To Do:**
Apply the framework to substantial work, demonstrate >60% agent usage, and document whether the framework actually works in practice.

### Expected Outcome

**Success Looks Like:**
- Agent usage rate consistently >60% throughout session
- Parallel agents used for independent tasks
- All >5k token tasks properly delegated
- Framework followed systematically
- Evidence that framework actually improves discipline
- Clear documentation of success/issues

**This Is Important Because:**
We need proof the framework works before mandating it project-wide. Your session will either validate the framework or identify needed improvements.

---

## Framework Overview

### Purpose

The agent discipline framework exists to prevent the meta-orchestrator from falling into "implementer mode" and doing work that should be delegated to agents.

**Core Principle:** Meta-orchestrators should spend 60-70% of their token budget delegating to agents, NOT implementing directly.

**Why It Matters:**
- Agents save ~79% tokens per task
- Parallel agents dramatically accelerate work
- Orchestrator focus should be on coordination, not implementation
- Token efficiency compounds quickly

### Key Documents To Read

**MANDATORY reading before starting:**

1. **`/home/ichardart/code/clients/moura_quayle/website-mq-studio/docs/AGENT_DELEGATION_CHECKLIST.md`**
   - Quick reference for every task
   - Decision tree for agent delegation
   - Token estimation guide
   - Agent usage tracking template

2. **`/home/ichardart/code/clients/moura_quayle/website-mq-studio/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_DECISIONS_LOG.md`**
   - Read the "Decision: Meta-Orchestrator Agent Discipline Framework" section
   - Full rationale and enforcement mechanisms
   - Examples of correct vs incorrect approaches

3. **`/home/ichardart/idp-projects/meta-orchestrator-framework/docs/meta-orchestrator-v3.2-INIT.md`**
   - Core meta-orchestrator framework
   - Role definitions and boundaries
   - Agent coordination patterns

### Decision Tree Summary

```
┌─ Task >5k tokens? ───────────────────┐
│  YES → MUST spawn agent              │
│  NO  → Continue ↓                     │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─ Multiple independent tasks? ────────┐
│  YES → MUST spawn parallel agents    │
│        (ONE message, multiple Tasks) │
│  NO  → Continue ↓                     │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─ Substantial file operations? ───────┐
│  YES → SHOULD spawn agent             │
│  NO  → Continue ↓                     │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─ Combined work >10k tokens? ─────────┐
│  YES → MUST spawn coordinating agent │
│  NO  → May implement directly         │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Simple Version:**
- >5k tokens? Use agent
- Multiple independent tasks? Use parallel agents
- Not sure? Use agent anyway

### Success Metrics

**Per Task:**
- Tasks >5k tokens: 100% delegated to agents
- Independent tasks: 100% parallelized
- Token estimation: Documented before implementation

**Per Session:**
- Agent usage rate: >60% (target: 70%)
- Parallel execution: Used when 2+ independent tasks exist
- Mid-session checkpoints: Conducted at 30k, 60k, 90k token marks
- Documentation: Agent usage tracked in every response

---

## Testing Approach

### Session Start Protocol

**1. Read Framework Documents (First 5-10 minutes)**
```yaml
Read in this order:
1. This handover document (HANDOVER_AGENT_FRAMEWORK_TEST.md)
2. Agent delegation checklist (docs/AGENT_DELEGATION_CHECKLIST.md)
3. Implementation decisions log - Framework section
4. Meta-orchestrator framework (if needed)
```

**2. Choose Test Task**
Select one of the recommended tasks below (or propose your own substantial task).

**3. Create Delegation Plan**
Before ANY implementation:
- Break down task into components
- Estimate token cost per component
- Identify independent vs dependent tasks
- Plan agent delegation strategy
- Plan parallel execution where applicable

**4. Start Tracking Immediately**
Add agent usage tracking block to your FIRST response:
```yaml
[Agent Usage Check]
Session total tokens: 0
Direct implementation: 0 tokens (0%)
Agent delegation: 0 tokens (0%)
Agent usage rate: 0% (Target: >60%)
Status: STARTING
Action: Planning delegation strategy
```

### During Work Protocol

**Before EVERY Task:**
1. Run decision tree (is this >5k tokens?)
2. Check if parallelizable
3. Decide: agent or direct implementation?
4. Document reasoning

**During EVERY Response:**
Include agent usage tracking:
```yaml
[Agent Usage Check]
Session total tokens: X
Direct implementation: Y tokens (Z%)
Agent delegation: A tokens (B%)
Agent usage rate: C% (Target: >60%)
Status: GREEN/AMBER/RED
Action: [What you'll do differently if needed]
```

**Status Indicators:**
- **GREEN:** >60% agent usage - optimal, continue
- **AMBER:** 40-60% agent usage - increase delegation
- **RED:** <40% agent usage - STOP and evaluate

**At Checkpoints (30k, 60k, 90k tokens):**
1. Calculate agent usage rate
2. If <60%: Stop and evaluate delegation approach
3. Identify any missed opportunities
4. Adjust strategy for remaining work
5. Document checkpoint in response

### Session End Protocol

**1. Calculate Final Metrics**
```yaml
Final Session Metrics:
- Total tokens used: X / 200,000
- Direct implementation: Y tokens (Z%)
- Agent delegation: A tokens (B%)
- Final agent usage rate: C%
- Target met: YES/NO (target: >60%)
- Parallel agents used: X times
- Sequential agents used: Y times
```

**2. Document in SESSION_HISTORY.md**
Add complete session entry including:
- Agent usage analysis
- Delegation decisions made
- What worked well
- What didn't work
- Framework improvements needed
- Lessons learned

**3. Framework Assessment**
Answer these questions:
- Did the framework help you delegate properly?
- Did the checklist prevent direct implementation?
- Were the token estimates accurate?
- Did tracking increase awareness?
- What would improve the framework?

---

## Recommended Test Tasks

Choose ONE task that will allow meaningful testing of the framework.

### Option 1: Full Content Migration (RECOMMENDED)

**Task:** Migrate all remaining content from archive folders to content structure

**Scope:**
- 50+ watercolor artworks
- 6 landscape design projects
- 2 shufa calligraphy pieces
- 3-4 publications
- Associated images (100+ files)

**Estimated Token Size:** 40-50k tokens if done directly

**Why This Tests Framework Well:**
- Large enough to require proper delegation
- Clear opportunities for parallel agents (4-5 category agents)
- Independent subtasks (watercolors, landscapes, shufa, publications)
- Substantial file operations
- Easy to measure agent usage

**Delegation Strategy Example:**
```yaml
Message 1: Spawn 5 parallel agents
  - Agent 1: Watercolors batch 1 (15 items)
  - Agent 2: Watercolors batch 2 (15 items)
  - Agent 3: Watercolors batch 3 (15 items)
  - Agent 4: Landscape designs (6 items)
  - Agent 5: Shufa + Publications (5 items)

Orchestrator: Synthesize results, verify consistency

Expected savings: 40-50k work → 8-10k orchestration = 75-80% savings
Expected agent usage: ~75%
```

**Prerequisites:**
- User has reviewed and approved the sample from Session #004
- See `/home/ichardart/code/clients/moura_quayle/website-mq-studio/CONTENT_MIGRATION_SAMPLE_REVIEW.md`

### Option 2: Test Suite Expansion

**Task:** Expand Playwright test coverage to include all gallery pages and interactions

**Scope:**
- Gallery navigation tests (artworks, musings, publications)
- Filter interaction tests
- Responsive behavior tests
- Search integration tests
- Accessibility tests
- Total: 25-30 new tests

**Estimated Token Size:** 30-40k tokens if done directly

**Why This Tests Framework Well:**
- Multiple independent test files
- Clear parallelization opportunities (5-6 test files)
- Substantial but not overwhelming scope
- Measurable outcomes (test count, pass rate)

**Delegation Strategy Example:**
```yaml
Message 1: Spawn 5 parallel agents
  - Agent 1: Gallery navigation tests
  - Agent 2: Filter interaction tests
  - Agent 3: Responsive design tests
  - Agent 4: Search integration tests
  - Agent 5: Accessibility tests

Orchestrator: Review test coverage, ensure consistency

Expected savings: 30-40k work → 6-8k orchestration = 75-80% savings
Expected agent usage: ~75%
```

### Option 3: Documentation Restructuring

**Task:** Reorganize and enhance project documentation for maintainability

**Scope:**
- Audit all documentation files (20+ files)
- Create documentation index
- Standardize format across documents
- Add cross-references
- Create developer onboarding guide
- Create content authoring guide
- Update README

**Estimated Token Size:** 25-35k tokens if done directly

**Why This Tests Framework Well:**
- Multiple independent documents
- Parallelizable by document type
- Requires coordination but not dependencies
- Good test of agent coordination

**Delegation Strategy Example:**
```yaml
Message 1: Spawn 4 parallel agents
  - Agent 1: Technical docs (architecture, setup, testing)
  - Agent 2: Process docs (sessions, decisions, issues)
  - Agent 3: Content docs (authoring, migration)
  - Agent 4: Create index + README

Orchestrator: Ensure consistency, verify cross-references

Expected savings: 25-35k work → 5-7k orchestration = ~75% savings
Expected agent usage: ~70%
```

### Option 4: Performance Optimization

**Task:** Systematic performance analysis and optimization

**Scope:**
- Page load time analysis (all routes)
- Image optimization opportunities
- Bundle size analysis
- Code splitting recommendations
- Caching strategy review
- Lighthouse audits for all pages
- Implementation of top 5 improvements

**Estimated Token Size:** 30-40k tokens if done directly

**Why This Tests Framework Well:**
- Multiple independent analysis areas
- Clear parallel opportunities (analyze different routes)
- Mix of analysis and implementation
- Measurable outcomes (performance scores)

**Delegation Strategy Example:**
```yaml
Message 1: Spawn 3 parallel agents
  - Agent 1: Analyze homepage + gallery routes
  - Agent 2: Analyze search + content routes
  - Agent 3: Image optimization analysis

Review results → Spawn implementation agents

Message 2: Spawn 3 parallel agents
  - Agent 4: Implement image optimization
  - Agent 5: Implement code splitting
  - Agent 6: Implement caching improvements

Expected savings: 30-40k work → 8-10k orchestration = ~75% savings
Expected agent usage: ~70%
```

## Framework Application Protocol

### Step-by-Step: How To Use Framework

**STEP 1: Session Initialization (First 10 minutes)**
```
1. Read AGENT_DELEGATION_CHECKLIST.md
2. Read this handover document
3. Review SESSION_HISTORY.md for context
4. Choose test task
5. Announce delegation strategy
```

**STEP 2: Task Breakdown (Next 10-15 minutes)**
```
1. Analyze task complexity
2. Break into components
3. Estimate token cost per component
4. Identify independent vs dependent tasks
5. Create delegation plan
6. Get user approval if needed
```

**STEP 3: Before Each Implementation**
```
Run checklist:
- [ ] Token estimate calculated?
- [ ] >5k tokens? → Agent required
- [ ] Multiple independent tasks? → Parallel agents
- [ ] Can parallelize? → Spawn all in one message
- [ ] Current agent usage rate? → On track?
```

**STEP 4: Agent Spawning**
```
For single agent:
  - Clear task description
  - Success criteria
  - Files to modify
  - Context needed

For parallel agents:
  - ONE message with multiple Task calls
  - Independent work only
  - No dependencies between agents
  - Clear success criteria for each
```

**STEP 5: Agent Usage Tracking**
```
Add to EVERY response:
[Agent Usage Check]
Session total tokens: X
Direct implementation: Y (Z%)
Agent delegation: A (B%)
Agent usage rate: C%
Status: GREEN/AMBER/RED
Action: [Next steps]
```

**STEP 6: Mid-Session Checkpoints**
```
At 30k tokens:
  - Calculate usage rate
  - If <60%: evaluate and adjust
  - Document any issues

At 60k tokens:
  - Re-check usage rate
  - Confirm delegation working
  - Adjust if needed

At 90k tokens:
  - Final checkpoint
  - On track for target?
  - Document patterns
```

**STEP 7: Session Completion**
```
1. Calculate final agent usage rate
2. Document in SESSION_HISTORY.md
3. Include:
   - Agent usage metrics
   - Delegation decisions
   - What worked
   - What didn't work
   - Framework improvements needed
   - Lessons learned
```

---

## Agent Usage Tracking Template

**Copy this into EVERY response:**

```yaml
[Agent Usage Check]
Session total tokens: 0 (Update with running total)
Direct implementation: 0 tokens (0%)
Agent delegation: 0 tokens (0%)
Agent usage rate: 0% (Target: >60%)
Status: STARTING | GREEN | AMBER | RED
Action: [What you're doing / adjusting]

Breakdown this response:
- Planning/analysis: X tokens
- Direct implementation: Y tokens (if any - justify why)
- Agent delegation: Z tokens (Task tool calls)
- Documentation: A tokens
```

**Status Definitions:**
- **STARTING:** Session just beginning, planning phase
- **GREEN:** Agent usage >60%, on track, continue current approach
- **AMBER:** Agent usage 40-60%, increase delegation, evaluate approach
- **RED:** Agent usage <40%, STOP and reassess, major adjustment needed

**Action Examples:**
- GREEN: "Continue with planned parallel agent spawning"
- AMBER: "Next task will use agent instead of direct implementation"
- RED: "Stopping to replan delegation strategy for remaining work"

## Orchestrator Model Recommendation

### Recommended Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5

**Why This Model:**
- Optimal balance of capability and cost for orchestration
- Strong at task breakdown and planning
- Good at systematic checklist following
- Sufficient context window for framework docs
- Cost-effective for delegation-heavy work

**Model Characteristics:**
- Excels at meta-cognitive tasks (planning, coordination)
- Strong instruction following
- Good at self-monitoring and correction
- Effective at parallel task identification

### Token Budget Expectations

**200K Token Budget Breakdown:**

**Optimal Allocation:**
- Framework reading: 5-10K tokens (5%)
- Planning/coordination: 15-20K tokens (10%)
- Agent delegation: 120-140K tokens (60-70%)
- Result synthesis: 20-30K tokens (15%)
- Documentation: 10-15K tokens (5%)

**This Achieves:**
- 60-70% agent usage target
- Sufficient planning time
- Comprehensive documentation
- Buffer for adjustments

**Warning Signs:**
- Direct implementation >40%: Stop and evaluate
- Planning >20%: May be overthinking
- Documentation <5%: Won't have audit trail

### Alternative Model Considerations

**If Sonnet 4.5 Unavailable:**
- Haiku: NOT RECOMMENDED (insufficient for orchestration complexity)
- Opus: Acceptable but unnecessarily expensive for this task
- Sonnet 3.5: Acceptable fallback

## Expected Challenges

### Challenge 1: Temptation to Implement Directly

**What It Looks Like:**
- "This is just a small fix, I'll do it quickly"
- "Reading files won't take long, no need for agent"
- "The agent overhead isn't worth it for this simple task"

**Why It Happens:**
- Momentum bias (want to keep moving)
- Task granularity misjudgment (5 small tasks = 1 big task)
- Underestimating token cost
- "Flow state" feels productive

**How To Resist:**
- ALWAYS run token estimate FIRST
- Remember: 5 tasks × 4k = 20k tokens (requires agent!)
- Checklist is mandatory, not optional
- Track usage in every response (accountability)

**Self-Correction Protocol:**
If you catch yourself implementing >5k token work:
1. STOP immediately
2. Acknowledge: "I should have used an agent"
3. Reframe task for agent
4. Spawn appropriate agent(s)
5. Update usage tracking with correction note

### Challenge 2: Misjudging Task Token Size

**What It Looks Like:**
- "This edit is just 10 lines, probably 2k tokens"
- "I'll just read these 3 files quickly"
- Reality: 8k tokens (should have used agent)

**Why It Happens:**
- Forgetting to count context reading
- Not accounting for verification steps
- Underestimating planning overhead
- Missing cascading edits

**How To Avoid:**
- Use token estimation guide in checklist
- Add 50% buffer to initial estimates
- Count: reading + planning + editing + verification
- When in doubt, assume larger

**Token Estimation Formula:**
```
Task tokens =
  Context reading (all files touched)
  + Planning/analysis
  + Implementation (editing)
  + Verification/testing
  + Documentation
  × 1.5 (buffer)
```

### Challenge 3: Missing Parallelization Opportunities

**What It Looks Like:**
- Spawning 3 agents sequentially (3 messages)
- Completing task 1, then task 2, then task 3
- Not recognizing independent tasks

**Why It Happens:**
- Default to sequential thinking
- Concerned about agent coordination overhead
- Not analyzing task dependencies carefully

**How To Identify Parallel Opportunities:**
```yaml
Questions to ask:
1. Do these tasks touch different files?
   → YES = Can parallelize

2. Does task B need results from task A?
   → NO = Can parallelize

3. Will results conflict or need merging?
   → NO = Can parallelize

4. Is there 2+ tasks total?
   → YES = Should evaluate parallel
```

**Parallel Agent Syntax:**
```
ONE message with multiple Task tool calls:
- Task 1: [Description]
- Task 2: [Description]
- Task 3: [Description]

All spawn simultaneously, work in parallel, report back
```

### Challenge 4: Framework Overhead Feels Burdensome

**What It Looks Like:**
- "Adding tracking block to every response is tedious"
- "Token estimation takes time away from real work"
- "Checklist slows me down"

**Why It Happens:**
- Framework adds meta-cognitive overhead
- Tracking feels like busywork initially
- Benefits aren't immediately obvious

**Why It's Worth It:**
- Tracking takes ~100 tokens per response
- Prevents 5-15k token waste per mistake
- ROI: 1:50 to 1:150
- Builds discipline that becomes automatic

**Making It Easier:**
- Copy/paste tracking template
- Update numbers mechanically
- Token estimation gets faster with practice
- Framework becomes second nature

### Challenge 5: Getting Caught Implementing Without Realizing

**What It Looks Like:**
- 5 minutes into reading and editing files
- Realize you've spent 8k tokens
- No agent was spawned

**Why It Happens:**
- Flow state bypasses conscious evaluation
- Small tasks compound invisibly
- Checklist forgotten in the moment

**Prevention:**
- Make token tracking automatic (every response)
- Set mental tripwire: "Am I reading a 2nd file? Agent time"
- Announce intention before acting: "I'm now going to [X]"
- Mid-response reality check: "Am I implementing or orchestrating?"

**Recovery:**
If caught in progress:
1. STOP (don't finish the task)
2. Document: "I implemented directly, should have used agent"
3. Save progress so far
4. Spawn agent to complete remaining work
5. Update tracking with correction
6. Reflect: Why did checklist fail? What would prevent this?

---

## Self-Correction Examples

### Example 1: Caught Implementing Test Fixes

**Scenario:**
You've edited 2 test files (800 lines total), 6k tokens spent.

**Self-Correction:**
```
STOP: I should have spawned an agent for this.

Analysis:
- Task: Fix 3 failing tests
- Estimated tokens: ~15k (across all 3 tests)
- Actual so far: 6k (2/3 tests)
- Should have: Spawned 3 parallel agents

Correction:
1. Save current progress
2. Spawn agent for remaining test + verification
3. Update tracking:
   [Agent Usage Check]
   Session total tokens: 6,000
   Direct implementation: 6,000 (100%) ← Should be 0
   Agent delegation: 0 (0%)
   Agent usage rate: 0% (Target: >60%)
   Status: RED - Caught implementing directly
   Action: Spawning agent for remaining work, will evaluate delegation for all future tasks

Lesson: Should have run decision tree before starting.
Next time: ANY multi-file work = agent
```

### Example 2: Missing Parallel Opportunity

**Scenario:**
You spawned agent for task A, waited for completion, then spawned agent for task B.

**Self-Correction:**
```
REFLECTION: I could have parallelized those tasks.

Analysis:
- Task A: Update documentation (no dependencies)
- Task B: Fix test suite (no dependencies)
- Tasks are independent
- Should have: ONE message with 2 agents

Impact:
- Sequential: 20 min total (10 + 10)
- Parallel: 10 min total (concurrent)
- Lost time: 10 minutes

Learning:
Before spawning ANY agent, ask: "Are there other independent tasks?"
If YES: spawn all in one message

Next parallel opportunity: Will identify upfront and spawn together
```

### Example 3: Token Estimation Was Wrong

**Scenario:**
Estimated task at 3k tokens (below threshold), actually took 9k.

**Self-Correction:**
```
STOP: This task exceeded estimates.

Analysis:
- Estimated: 3k tokens (seemed small, no agent)
- Actual: 9k tokens (should have used agent)
- Error: Forgot to count file reading context

Why estimate was wrong:
- Only counted editing time
- Didn't count: reading 4 files (3k) + planning (1k) + verification (2k)
- Real formula: read + plan + edit + verify

Correction:
- This task is too late to fix
- Document in tracking
- Update estimation for future tasks

[Agent Usage Check]
Session total tokens: 15,000
Direct implementation: 15,000 (100%)
Agent delegation: 0 (0%)
Agent usage rate: 0% (Target: >60%)
Status: RED - Estimation error led to direct implementation
Action: Adding 50% buffer to all future estimates

Lesson: Use estimation formula from checklist, add buffer
```

## Conclusion: Your Mission

**You are testing something important.**

Session #004 created a framework to ensure proper agent discipline. But frameworks mean nothing until proven in practice.

**Your job is to:**
1. Apply the framework systematically
2. Execute substantial work (>30k tokens worth)
3. Achieve >60% agent usage
4. Document what works and what doesn't
5. Prove the framework actually helps OR identify what needs improvement

**Success means:**
- You maintain >60% agent usage throughout
- The checklist prevented you from implementing directly
- You caught yourself when discipline slipped
- Framework improved your orchestration effectiveness
- Clear evidence this approach works

**Failure means:**
- You fall back to <60% agent usage despite trying
- Framework didn't prevent direct implementation
- Checklist was confusing or unhelpful
- Overhead outweighed benefits

**Either outcome is valuable** - we need to know if the framework works.

**What happens next:**
- If framework works: Mandate it project-wide
- If framework needs refinement: You document improvements
- If framework fails: We try a different approach

**The future of agent discipline in this project depends on your session.**

Go forth and delegate!
