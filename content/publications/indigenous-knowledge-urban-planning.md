description: "Exploring how Indigenous knowledge systems can inform urban planning through partnerships with First Nations communities."
abstract: "This collaborative research explores how Indigenous knowledge systems can meaningfully inform urban planning practice in settler-colonial contexts. Through partnerships with three First Nations communities in British Columbia, we examine both the possibilities and challenges of integrating traditional ecological knowledge, governance structures, and spatial practices into contemporary planning frameworks. Our findings suggest that genuine integration requires not just consultation but fundamental shifts in planning epistemologies."

## Positionality Statement

This research was conducted in partnership with members of the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations on whose unceded territories Vancouver is located. The lead author acknowledges her position as a settler-scholar and the limitations this brings to understanding Indigenous ways of knowing.

## Introduction

Urban planning has historically been a tool of colonization, imposing Western spatial logic onto Indigenous territories. As planning professionals increasingly recognize this legacy, questions arise: Can colonial planning frameworks meaningfully incorporate Indigenous knowledge? Or does genuine reconciliation require more fundamental transformation?

## Methodology

This research employed a collaborative methodology developed in partnership with Indigenous community members. Over eighteen months, we engaged in sharing circles, land-based learning, and co-design workshops that centered Indigenous protocols and knowledge systems.

## Key Themes

### Time and Temporality
Indigenous planning horizons often extend seven generations into the future, fundamentally challenging Western planning's typical 20-30 year frameworks. This temporal difference reflects different relationships to land, responsibility, and continuity.

### Relationality and Reciprocity
Where Western planning often views land as resource or property, Indigenous knowledge systems emphasize relationships of reciprocity with the land and all beings. This shift from ownership to relationship requires reimagining fundamental planning concepts.

### Governance and Decision-Making
Traditional governance structures based on consensus, hereditary leadership, and seasonal cycles offer alternatives to contemporary planning's bureaucratic frameworks. Integration requires flexibility in institutional structures.

## Challenges and Tensions

The research identified several persistent challenges:
- Power imbalances in consultation processes
- Institutional resistance to epistemological change
- Time constraints of political cycles versus relationship-building needs
- Risk of tokenization or appropriation of Indigenous knowledge

## Pathways Forward

Genuine integration of Indigenous knowledge into planning practice requires:
1. Institutional willingness to share power and modify established processes
2. Long-term commitment to relationship-building beyond project timelines
3. Recognition that Indigenous knowledge belongs to Indigenous peoples and cannot be simply "applied"
4. Creation of new planning frameworks that can hold multiple knowledge systems simultaneously

## Conclusions

This research demonstrates that incorporating Indigenous knowledge into urban planning is both possible and essential, but only through approaches that fundamentally challenge colonial planning paradigms. Reconciliation in planning practice demands not just inclusion but transformation.
