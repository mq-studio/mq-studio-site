## Introduction

Universities stand at a crossroads. The traditional model of higher education—designed for a different century and different challenges—faces pressures from multiple directions: fiscal constraints, technological disruption, changing student demographics, demands for relevance, questions about equity and access, and fundamental debates about the role of universities in democratic societies.

This proposal argues that the question is not whether universities must change but what kinds of change will strengthen rather than diminish their essential purposes.

## Core Challenges

### 1. Mission Clarity in a Market Environment

Universities increasingly face pressure to operate as market-responsive organizations, optimizing for metrics like enrollment, research dollars, and rankings. Yet their deeper purposes—knowledge creation, critical inquiry, education for citizenship, long-term stewardship—cannot be reduced to market logic.

**Strategic Question:** How do universities maintain mission integrity while responding to legitimate external pressures?

### 2. Governance for Complexity

Traditional university governance structures—designed for disciplinary autonomy and incremental change—struggle with challenges that cross boundaries: climate change, digital transformation, reconciliation, equity.

**Strategic Question:** How do governance structures enable integrated institutional response while preserving academic freedom and collegial decision-making?

### 3. Teaching and Learning Innovation

Pedagogical innovation often remains at the margins of institutional culture, treated as optional enhancement rather than core practice. Meanwhile, technological change and evolving student needs demand fundamental rethinking of educational models.

**Strategic Question:** How do universities center teaching and learning innovation without sacrificing depth and rigor?

### 4. Research Impact and Public Engagement

Universities increasingly recognize the importance of research impact beyond academic publications, yet systems of recognition and reward remain largely unchanged.

**Strategic Question:** How do universities value and support diverse forms of scholarship, including community-engaged research and knowledge mobilization?

### 5. Equity, Inclusion, and Decolonization

Commitments to equity, diversity, and decolonization require more than policy statements; they demand transformation of curriculum, pedagogy, governance, and institutional culture.

**Strategic Question:** How do universities move from aspirational statements to structural change?

## A Framework for Transformation

### Principle 1: Values-Led Change

Rather than reactive adaptation to external pressures, universities should lead change grounded in core academic values:
- Commitment to truth-seeking and critical inquiry
- Service to the public good
- Stewardship of knowledge across generations
- Equity and inclusion
- Academic freedom and institutional autonomy

### Principle 2: Integrated Planning

Complex challenges require integrated institutional response:
- Cross-unit collaboration
- Multi-year strategic horizons
- Alignment of resources with priorities
- Transparent decision-making processes
- Regular assessment and adaptation

### Principle 3: Distributed Leadership

Transformation cannot be driven from the center alone:
- Faculty leadership at department and program levels
- Support for innovation and experimentation
- Recognition and reward for institutional citizenship
- Professional development for academic leadership
- Genuine shared governance

### Principle 4: Learning Organization

Universities must embody the learning they advocate:
- Evidence-informed decision-making
- Capacity for institutional reflection
- Willingness to change course based on outcomes
- Culture of continuous improvement
- Humility about what we don't yet know

## Strategic Initiatives

This proposal recommends six interconnected initiatives:

### 1. Governance Renewal

**Goal:** Create governance structures capable of addressing complex, cross-cutting challenges while maintaining academic freedom and collegial decision-making.

**Actions:**
- Review Senate structure and processes
- Strengthen integration between Senate and administrative decision-making
- Develop capacity for deliberative engagement on strategic questions
- Clarify roles and responsibilities across governance bodies

### 2. Pedagogical Innovation Infrastructure

**Goal:** Center teaching and learning innovation in institutional culture and practice.

**Actions:**
- Establish teaching and learning innovation hubs
- Create career pathways for educational leadership
- Invest in professional development for teaching excellence
- Recognize and reward pedagogical innovation in tenure and promotion

### 3. Research Impact Framework

**Goal:** Broaden understanding of research excellence to include diverse forms of scholarship and impact.

**Actions:**
- Develop institutional definition of research impact
- Create support for community-engaged scholarship
- Establish metrics for assessing diverse research contributions
- Align recognition and reward with expanded understanding of excellence

### 4. Integrated Planning Process

**Goal:** Develop institutional capacity for strategic planning that crosses traditional boundaries.

**Actions:**
- Establish cross-functional planning teams for major initiatives
- Create transparent processes for resource allocation
- Develop multi-year strategic horizons
- Build assessment and learning into planning cycles

### 5. Equity and Decolonization Strategy

**Goal:** Move from aspirational commitments to structural transformation.

**Actions:**
- Comprehensive curriculum review through equity and decolonization lens
- Faculty and staff professional development on inclusive pedagogy
- Review and revise policies through equity lens
- Strengthen partnerships with Indigenous communities
- Establish accountability mechanisms for equity goals

### 6. Digital Transformation with Human Purpose

**Goal:** Leverage digital tools in service of educational mission rather than allowing technology to drive institutional change.

**Actions:**
- Articulate institutional vision for digital teaching and learning
- Invest in human-centered digital infrastructure
- Support faculty experimentation with educational technology
- Maintain commitment to access and inclusion in digital environments

## Implementation Roadmap

### Year 1: Foundation
- Governance review and consultation
- Establish working groups for each initiative
- Develop detailed implementation plans
- Secure initial resources

### Years 2-3: Pilot and Learning
- Launch pilot projects for each initiative
- Build assessment frameworks
- Document learning and refine approaches
- Develop scaling strategies

### Years 4-5: Integration and Scaling
- Scale successful initiatives
- Integrate into regular institutional practice
- Establish ongoing mechanisms for renewal
- Assess progress toward strategic goals

## Conclusion: The University We Need

The challenges universities face are real and urgent. But crisis can be catalyst for renewal.

This proposal envisions universities that are:
- **Intellectually vibrant:** Spaces for rigorous inquiry and creative exploration
- **Socially responsible:** Institutions serving the public good and democratic flourishing
- **Structurally equitable:** Organizations that embody the justice they advocate
- **Pedagogically innovative:** Learning environments that prepare students for uncertain futures
- **Institutionally courageous:** Organizations willing to change in service of core purposes

This is not a vision of universities abandoning tradition but of institutions courageous enough to transform in fidelity to their deepest purposes.

The question before us is not whether change will come—it will—but whether we will lead that change or be led by it.

I invite the Faculty Senate to engage this proposal as a starting point for collective deliberation about the university we need and the pathways to bring it into being.
