## Project Overview

Metro Vancouver faces a critical paradox: surrounded by some of Canada's most productive agricultural land, the region imports over 90% of its food. Climate change, land speculation, aging farmer demographics, and supply chain vulnerabilities threaten both food security and agricultural viability. This project is developing a regional governance framework to coordinate food systems planning across 21 municipalities and multiple First Nations territories.

## The Governance Challenge

Food systems touch every aspect of urban and regional life—land use, water, energy, waste, health, education, economy, culture—yet governance is fragmented across multiple jurisdictions and sectors. Agricultural land is regulated provincially, food retail municipally, food assistance through health authorities, food procurement through individual institutions. No entity has responsibility for the system as a whole.

This project asks: How can we govern complex, cross-cutting systems when authority is distributed across multiple jurisdictions? How do we coordinate without creating new bureaucracy? How do we honor Indigenous food sovereignty while building regional capacity?

## Approach

### Systems Mapping
Phase 1 involved comprehensive mapping of:
- Existing governance structures and their jurisdictional boundaries
- Material flows (food, water, nutrients, waste, energy)
- Actor networks and power relationships
- Decision points and leverage opportunities
- Gaps and redundancies in current governance

This mapping was conducted participatively through workshops with 150+ stakeholders across sectors and jurisdictions.

### Case Study Research
Analysis of regional food governance in 8 jurisdictions internationally, examining:
- Coordination mechanisms
- Authority and accountability structures
- Funding models
- Equity and inclusion approaches
- Success factors and persistent challenges

### Co-Design Process
Rather than proposing a governance model to stakeholders, we've engaged in a 2-year co-design process:

**Round 1: Principles & Values** (6 months)
- What matters most about how we make decisions?
- Whose voices must be centered?
- What are non-negotiables?

**Round 2: Scenarios & Trade-offs** (6 months)
- Testing different governance models through scenario planning
- Surfacing tensions and trade-offs
- Building shared understanding of complexity

**Round 3: Framework Development** (12 months, ongoing)
- Iterative design of governance framework
- Testing components through pilot projects
- Continuous refinement based on feedback

## Emerging Framework Components

### Nested Governance Structure
Rather than a single new authority, the framework proposes nested governance at multiple scales:
- **Local**: Municipal food policy councils
- **Sub-regional**: Agricultural area coordination committees
- **Regional**: Metro Vancouver Food Systems Coordination Office
- **Indigenous**: Nation-specific food sovereignty initiatives with regional coordination protocols

### Coordination Mechanisms
- Shared regional food systems data platform
- Aligned municipal agricultural area planning
- Coordinated procurement across institutional buyers
- Regional land matching (connecting retiring farmers with new farmers)
- Indigenous food sovereignty support framework

### Funding Model
Innovative funding combining:
- Core regional district funding for coordination capacity
- Municipal contributions tied to food system benefits
- Provincial agricultural support program alignment
- Federal infrastructure funding for food assets
- Social enterprise revenue from regional food hub operations

## Innovation: Indigenous Food Sovereignty Integration

The most significant innovation has been developing a framework that supports Indigenous food sovereignty while building regional capacity. Working with 7 First Nations, we've designed:

- **Parallel Governance**: Nations govern their own food systems autonomously while choosing points of coordination with regional structures
- **Resource Sharing**: Regional infrastructure (processing, storage, distribution) accessible to support Nation food initiatives
- **Knowledge Protection**: Protocols for sharing traditional food knowledge while maintaining cultural authority
- **Economic Pathways**: Supporting Indigenous food enterprises and land-based practices

This approach acknowledges that Indigenous food sovereignty cannot be subsumed within regional planning, yet coordination can provide mutual benefits.

## Current Status (Year 2)

We're in the critical transition from framework design to implementation planning. The governance structure has broad stakeholder support, but implementation requires:

- Provincial legislation enabling regional food coordination authority
- Municipal council adoption across 21 jurisdictions
- Securing sustainable funding commitments
- Hiring coordination office staff
- Establishing pilot projects to demonstrate value

## Challenges

### Political Complexity
Food politics are intense. Every stakeholder group has strong positions: farmers wanting land protection, developers wanting flexibility, food justice advocates demanding equity focus, environmentalists emphasizing sustainability. Building consensus requires patience and genuine dialogue.

### Jurisdictional Authority
The project constantly navigates questions of authority: Who has the right to make decisions? How do we coordinate without overriding municipal autonomy? How do we acknowledge Indigenous jurisdiction in the region?

### Funding Sustainability
One-time project funding is easier to secure than ongoing operational funding. Making the case for sustained investment in coordination capacity requires demonstrating value that may take years to fully realize.

## Lessons Emerging

### Governance is Relationship
The most important outcome may not be the formal framework but the relationships built through the design process. Stakeholders who previously never talked now collaborate informally. This social infrastructure may matter more than institutional structures.

### Start Small, Learn Fast
We've embedded pilot projects throughout the design process rather than waiting for the complete framework. These tangible initiatives build trust and provide learning that informs framework development.

### Process Matters as Much as Product
How we design governance shapes the governance we design. A participatory process produces a more participatory framework. An extractive consultation process produces extractive governance.

## Personal Reflection

This is the most complex governance design challenge I've undertaken. Food systems touch everything, involve everyone, and trigger deep cultural and emotional responses. The work requires endless patience, genuine humility, and faith that slow, deliberative processes produce better outcomes than top-down solutions.

I'm constantly drawing on my landscape architecture training—the ability to hold multiple scales simultaneously, to see patterns and relationships, to design for emergence rather than control. Good landscape design creates frameworks within which life can flourish; good governance design does the same.

David reminds me regularly that we may not see the full realization of this work. That's okay. Like planting trees, we're creating conditions for a thriving future we may not inhabit. The measure of success is whether the framework can evolve and adapt long after my involvement ends.

## Upcoming Milestones

- **2024 Q4**: Regional District Board consideration of framework
- **2025 Q1-Q2**: Municipal council engagement process
- **2025 Q3**: Provincial policy alignment discussions
- **2025 Q4**: Implementation plan development
- **2026**: Coordination office launch (if funding secured)

This timeline is, of course, provisional. Governance change operates on its own schedule, shaped by political cycles, funding availability, and the slow work of building trust and shared understanding.
