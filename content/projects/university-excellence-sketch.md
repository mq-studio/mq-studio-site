This conceptual sketch represents an early-stage design inquiry into university campus planning, where spatial design intersects with questions of institutional purpose and excellence. The drawing explores how landscape architecture can support or challenge organizational culture and performance.

## Design Approach

The sketch employs a layered, multi-scalar approach to campus design thinking:

- **Human Scale**: Seating arrangements and gathering spaces that accommodate various modes of interaction
- **Landscape Elements**: Trees, pathways, and green spaces that structure movement and experience
- **Architectural Context**: Buildings and structures that frame and define outdoor spaces
- **Institutional Questions**: Annotations that probe the relationship between physical space and organizational excellence

## Key Questions Explored

The handwritten notes reveal the critical inquiry driving this design exploration:
- "What is excellence?" - Fundamental question about institutional purpose
- "What is university policy on firing people who don't do their jobs?" - Accountability and performance
- "Can we groom Brian to fit job?" - Human resource and organizational development concerns

These annotations demonstrate how landscape design thinking extends beyond aesthetics to engage with governance, policy, and institutional effectiveness.

## Design Philosophy

This sketch embodies a holistic approach to landscape design where questions of space, function, and organizational culture are inseparable. The loose, exploratory quality of the drawing suggests this is early-stage concept development where critical inquiry takes precedence over resolved solutions.
