## Project Overview

A conceptual landscape design study that interrogates the relationship between physical campus design and institutional values. This sketch-based exploration uses landscape architectural drawing techniques to pose fundamental questions about excellence, accountability, and the role of designed environments in academic settings.

## Design Approach

The sketch integrates multiple landscape elements:
- Mature tree canopies providing shade and gathering spaces
- Architectural structures and pathways creating circulation patterns
- Human-scale figures suggesting use and interaction
- Annotated questions embedding philosophical inquiry into the design process

## Conceptual Framework

The design raises provocative questions about institutional purpose: "What is excellence?" and explores how landscape design can create environments that support or challenge existing organizational structures. The work suggests that landscape architecture extends beyond aesthetic concerns to engage with deeper questions about how spaces shape behavior, values, and institutional culture.

## Significance

This project demonstrates an approach to landscape design that treats physical space as inseparable from institutional mission and human development. The integration of text and drawing creates a layered document that functions simultaneously as design sketch, philosophical inquiry, and institutional critique.
