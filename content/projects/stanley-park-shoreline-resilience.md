## Project Overview

Stanley Park, Vancouver's beloved urban forest, faces increasing coastal erosion and storm surge impacts due to climate change. This multi-year initiative developed adaptive strategies for 8 kilometers of shoreline, balancing ecological resilience, heritage preservation, recreational access, and Indigenous cultural values.

## Challenge

The 2021 atmospheric river event dramatically accelerated erosion along the seawall, damaging infrastructure and threatening century-old trees. Traditional hard engineering solutions would compromise the park's natural character and ecological function. The project required developing innovative approaches that could:

- Protect critical infrastructure while allowing natural coastal processes
- Maintain recreational access during decades of incremental adaptation
- Honor the cultural significance of the shoreline to Coast Salish peoples
- Work with natural systems rather than against them
- Accommodate future sea level rise uncertainty

## Approach

### Indigenous Partnership
From project inception, we worked in partnership with Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations environmental stewards. This collaboration fundamentally shaped the project approach, emphasizing:
- Traditional ecological knowledge of coastal processes
- Cultural plant species selection for restoration areas
- Beach access for continued traditional practices
- Long-term stewardship planning

### Adaptive Pathway Strategy
Rather than designing a single fixed solution, we developed a flexible "adaptive pathway" that allows for phased interventions as sea levels rise and erosion progresses. This approach acknowledges uncertainty while maintaining agency.

### Nature-Based Solutions
The design prioritizes working with natural processes:
- Strategic beach nourishment using sediment compatible with existing conditions
- Native vegetation restoration to stabilize slopes
- Engineered logjams to dissipate wave energy while creating habitat
- Elevated walkway sections allowing beach migration

### Community Co-Design
Over 18 months of engagement, including:
- Walking workshops along affected shoreline segments
- Design charrettes with diverse user groups
- Youth future-visioning sessions
- Elder storytelling events connecting past and future

## Key Innovations

### Temporal Flexibility in Design
The project introduced "designed obsolescence zones"—areas explicitly planned to change over time. Rather than building permanent infrastructure, certain sections use temporary interventions that can be modified as conditions evolve.

### Multi-Functional Infrastructure
New walkway segments serve multiple purposes:
- Recreation access (primary function)
- Emergency evacuation routes during storm events
- Sediment retention structures
- Observation platforms for ecological monitoring

### Living Laboratory
The project includes extensive monitoring protocols and is structured as a living laboratory, with data shared publicly to advance understanding of nature-based coastal adaptation.

## Outcomes (Phase 1)

- 2.3 km of adapted shoreline completed
- 12,000+ native plants established
- 85% reduction in erosion rates in treated areas
- Zero storm damage to seawall in Phase 1 area during 2023-24 winter
- 47% increase in use of adapted areas compared to pre-project baseline
- 3 published research papers on monitoring results

## Challenges & Lessons

### Institutional Timescales
The hardest challenge was aligning the long timescales required for effective adaptation with institutional planning and budget cycles. Success required persistent education and relationship-building across multiple political administrations.

### Managing Uncertainty
Designing for uncertain futures proved both technically and politically challenging. Stakeholders wanted definitive answers; the science could only offer scenarios and probabilities.

### Balancing Values
Competing values around "naturalness" emerged repeatedly. Some stakeholders wanted minimal intervention; others wanted engineered protection. The resolution lay in extensive dialogue about what "natural" means in an urban park facing climate change.

## Personal Reflection

This project brought together every aspect of my practice—landscape architecture, governance, community engagement, and climate adaptation. It required both technical expertise and the kind of wisdom that only comes from listening: to communities, to Indigenous knowledge-holders, to the land itself.

Standing on the Third Beach segment we completed, watching winter storms test our adaptive design, I'm reminded that this work is never finished. We haven't "solved" coastal erosion; we've created a framework for ongoing adaptation. Success means the project can continue to evolve long after my involvement ends.

That feels like the right measure of success: designing systems that don't need their designers.

## Project Team Recognition

This work was only possible through genuine collaboration. Particular thanks to:
- Elder Larry Grant (Musqueam) for cultural guidance
- Sarah Mitchell (Squamish Nation) for environmental stewardship leadership
- The PWL design team for translating vision into buildable form
- Vancouver Park Board staff for navigating institutional complexities
- The 800+ community members who participated in co-design
- David Fushtey for research support and patience during late-night design sessions
