artistStatement: "This square-format piece presents a line from Tang dynasty landscape poetry: '靜觀山色' (jìng guān shān sè) - 'In stillness, observe the mountain's colors.' Written in regular script with subtle applications of mineral pigment, it bridges traditional calligraphy and landscape painting, suggesting rather than depicting the mountain presence."
exhibitionHistory: []
technicalNotes: "Executed on double-layer xuan paper using sumi ink in regular script (kaishu). Subtle washes of mineral blue and green pigments were added after the calligraphy dried, creating atmospheric depth without obscuring the brushwork. The square format and centered composition emphasize stability and contemplation."

## The Poetry

靜觀山色 (jìng guān shān sè) can be translated as "In stillness, observe the mountain's colors" or "Quietly contemplate the mountain's appearance." This line fragment embodies a core principle of Chinese landscape appreciation: that true seeing requires inner stillness.

The phrase comes from the tradition of landscape poetry (shānshuǐ shī, 山水詩) developed during the Tang and Song dynasties, where observation of nature was understood as a spiritual practice rather than merely aesthetic experience.

## Regular Script

For this piece I chose kaishu (楷書, regular script), the most formal and structured style of Chinese calligraphy. Each character sits within an invisible square, each stroke is distinct and clear. Regular script is often called "the body of calligraphy"—it's the foundation upon which all other styles are built.

Using regular script for a phrase about stillness and observation feels appropriate. The clarity and structure of the script itself embodies the quiet, attentive state the phrase describes.

## The Square Format

Unlike traditional vertical scrolls, this piece uses a square format (douˇfāng, 斗方). The square is associated with earth and stability in Chinese cosmology, while the circle represents heaven and movement. The square format creates a contemplative, grounded energy.

Within this square, the four characters are arranged in a 2x2 grid, creating both symmetry and dynamic relationship. The eye moves around the composition in a gentle circulation rather than following a linear path.

## Mineral Pigments

After the calligraphy was complete and thoroughly dry, I added subtle washes of traditional mineral pigments: azurite blue (shíqīng, 石青) and malachite green (shílǜ, 石綠). These are the same pigments used in classical Chinese landscape painting.

The pigments were applied in very dilute washes, barely visible, suggesting atmospheric perspective and mountain mist without competing with the calligraphy. This technique comes from the literati painting tradition where calligraphy and painting are considered sister arts, both forms of expressive brushwork.

## Stillness as Practice

The character 靜 (jìng, stillness) appears first. In both Daoist and Buddhist practice, stillness is not passive but active—a quality of focused, alert attention. It's the stillness of the mountain itself: unmoving yet fully alive, responsive to every shift of light and weather.

This concept challenges our cultural emphasis on constant activity and productivity. What can we observe when we stop moving? What wisdom emerges from patient attention?

## Mountains in Chinese Culture

Mountains hold profound significance in Chinese thought. They are places of transcendence where hermits, poets, and monks retreat to cultivate wisdom. They represent permanence, stability, and the bridge between earth and heaven.

The Chinese phrase 山色 (shān sè, mountain colors) is rich with meaning. 色 (sè) means color but also form, appearance, and in Buddhist context, the material world itself. To observe mountain colors is to engage with the physical manifestation of deeper truths.

## The Act of Observation

觀 (guān, to observe) is a complex character. Its components include "see" and an implied sense of comprehensive viewing or contemplation. It's related to the word for Daoist temple (dàoguān, 道觀) and suggests not just looking but penetrating vision that sees essence beyond appearance.

In my governance work, I often return to this character. Effective policy requires this kind of deep, patient observation—seeing not just surface phenomena but underlying patterns and relationships.

## Bridging Traditions

This piece bridges several traditions: calligraphy, landscape painting, and poetry. In Chinese culture, these were never separate disciplines but different expressions of the same cultivated sensibility. A scholar was expected to be competent in all three, collectively known as the "three perfections" (sānjué, 三絕).

The integration of these arts reflects a holistic worldview where distinctions between visual art, literature, and philosophy are less rigid than in Western categorization.

## Personal Practice

I created this piece after returning from a week in the North Cascades, where I spent each dawn sitting still, watching light move across mountain faces. The practice of physical stillness, letting go of the impulse to document or describe, allowing simple presence—this is what the characters attempt to encode.

Calligraphy becomes a way to distill experience without describing it, to evoke a state of being without explaining it.

## Contemporary Resonance

In our era of constant connectivity and distraction, the instruction to "in stillness, observe" feels both ancient wisdom and urgent necessity. We have unprecedented ability to see vast amounts of information, yet perhaps less capacity for the kind of sustained, quiet observation that yields understanding.

This calligraphy hangs as both artwork and instruction, a reminder that seeing requires stopping, that understanding emerges from patient attention rather than quick consumption.

## The Empty Space

In the Chinese aesthetic tradition, empty space is never merely background but an active element. The white paper around these four characters is not void but fullness—the mountain mist, the quiet space of contemplation, the breath between words.

This treatment of emptiness offers another teaching: that what is absent is as important as what is present, that space for reflection is as valuable as the object of reflection.
