artistStatement: "This working sketch captures a moment of design thinking, exploring fundamental questions about university spaces and their role in shaping community. The annotations ask 'What is excellence?' and 'What is university policy on firing people who don't do their jobs?' revealing the integration of spatial planning with institutional governance concerns. The sketch layers architectural elements, landscape features, and human figures, demonstrating the interconnected nature of place-making and policy. A raw, unfiltered glimpse into the design process where questions drive exploration. [AI GENERATED - PLACEHOLDER]"

A revealing glimpse into the designer's sketchbook, this pen and ink drawing explores conceptual ideas about university campus design and institutional excellence. The sketch layers multiple perspectives and scales, from intimate seating arrangements to broader landscape gestures, all unified by hand-drawn lines and thoughtful annotations.

The text notations reveal the deeper inquiry driving the design processâ€”questions about excellence, institutional accountability, and the role of designed spaces in supporting or hindering an organization's mission. This is design thinking made visible, where the act of drawing becomes a tool for asking critical questions.

The sketch includes various landscape elements: trees, pathways, seating areas, and human figures that suggest how people might inhabit and move through these spaces. The loose, gestural quality of the linework conveys exploration and possibility rather than fixed solutions.
