artistStatement: "This vertical scroll presents the Daoist phrase '上善若水' (shàng shàn ruò shuǐ) - 'The highest good is like water.' Executed in cursive script, the calligraphy itself embodies the concept it describes: fluid, continuous, adapting to the constraints of the vertical format while maintaining its essential energy and direction."

technicalNotes: "Created using traditional sumi ink on long-fiber xuan paper in the cursive (caoshu) style. The vertical format and continuous stroke connection create a visual descent that mirrors water flowing downward. Mounted as a hanging scroll with silk brocade borders."

## The Phrase

上善若水 (shàng shàn ruò shuǐ) comes from Chapter 8 of the Daodejing (Tao Te Ching), the foundational text of Daoism attributed to Laozi. The full passage reads:

"The highest good is like water. Water benefits all things and does not compete. It flows to the lowest places that people disdain. In this way it is like the Dao."

This teaching has profound implications for leadership, governance, and how we move through the world. Water doesn't force its way; it finds the path of least resistance yet ultimately reshapes everything it encounters.

## Cursive Script as Water

I chose caoshu (草書, cursive or "grass" script) for this piece because it most closely embodies the quality of water. In cursive script, characters flow into each other, strokes connect across character boundaries, and the brush rarely leaves the paper. The result is more like a river than a sequence of separate forms.

Cursive script requires extensive practice with regular script first. You must deeply know the structure before you can deconstruct it. Like water, cursive calligraphy appears spontaneous and free but actually operates according to deep natural laws.

## The Vertical Format

Traditional Chinese calligraphy reads top to bottom, right to left. This vertical orientation creates a natural sense of descent, perfect for a phrase about water. The composition takes advantage of this gravity, with the brushwork becoming more fluid and connected as it descends, as if the ink itself is flowing downward.

The narrow, tall format of a hanging scroll (tiaofú, 條幅) emphasizes this vertical movement and creates an intimate viewing experience. The viewer's eye must travel, must follow the path the water takes.

## Technical Challenges

Cursive script demands confidence and momentum. The brush cannot hesitate—hesitation breaks the flow and shows immediately in the line quality. Yet this confidence must be controlled, aware, responsive to the particular qualities of each moment: the remaining ink in the brush, the texture of the paper, the humidity of the air.

The challenge is similar to what water navigates: maintaining essential character while adapting to constantly changing conditions.

## Water as Teacher

In my work as a landscape architect and scholar of governance, I return again and again to water as teacher. Water shows us:

- **Patience**: Water can wear away stone, but takes time
- **Adaptability**: Water assumes the shape of its container without losing its nature
- **Persistence**: Water always finds a way through or around obstacles
- **Humility**: Water seeks the lowest place, yet this is its strength
- **Generosity**: Water benefits all things without discrimination

These qualities are essential for effective governance and community building. Rigid systems break; flexible systems adapt and endure.

## The Practice

This piece required multiple practice sessions before the final execution. In Chinese calligraphy tradition, one typically practices a piece many times on newsprint before attempting the final version on good paper.

But here's the paradox: the final version must not look practiced. It must contain the same fresh energy as the first spontaneous attempt, but with the refinement of considered execution. This balance between preparation and spontaneity is at the heart of all accomplished art.

## Contemporary Relevance

In our current moment of climate crisis, political polarization, and rigid ideological positions, water's teaching becomes even more urgent. We need governance systems that can adapt, leadership that can find ways through obstacles rather than attempting to dominate them, and policies that benefit all beings rather than competing for scarce resources.

This calligraphy is both meditation and manifesto: a reminder that the ancient Daoist wisdom about flowing like water is not merely poetic metaphor but practical philosophy for how to be in the world.

## On Energy Flow

Chinese calligraphy cultivates qi (氣), the vital energy that flows through all living things. The quality of qi in calligraphy is palpable—you can feel whether the line is alive or dead, whether the energy flows or stagnates.

In this piece, I worked to maintain continuous qi from the first stroke to the last. The brush lifts and touches down, the ink varies from wet to dry, but the energetic thread remains unbroken, like a stream maintaining its identity whether flowing over rapids or through placid pools.

This energetic continuity transforms the characters from mere writing into a living record of breath, movement, and presence.
