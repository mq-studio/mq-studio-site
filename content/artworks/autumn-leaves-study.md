This piece emerged from a personal practice: observing the same maple branch each morning during my coffee, watching it transform from green density to golden transparency over the course of autumn.

## Process Notes

The challenge in botanical watercolor is balancing observation with interpretation. Too much detail and the work becomes illustration; too little and it loses connection to the specific living thing being honored.

I worked in layers, beginning with pale yellow washes to establish the underlying glow, then building up oranges and reds, saving the deepest burgundy for only the most shadowed areas. The ink work came last—fine lines suggesting the intricate venation that becomes visible only as the leaves thin and dry.

## What Trees Teach

Watching this branch over weeks taught me about letting go—how trees don't cling to what no longer serves them, how they prepare for release through transformation rather than sudden loss. Each leaf changed at its own pace, the branch slowly becoming lighter, more open, more itself.

There's a parallel here to institutional change. Organizations often try to transform overnight, mandating new practices while the culture remains unchanged. Trees know better: transformation requires preparation, time, and trust in the process.

## Technical Challenges

The difficulty in this piece was maintaining luminosity while building color intensity. Watercolor darkens as it dries, and multiple layers can quickly become muddy. Success required careful planning of which areas to leave light, where to introduce more saturated color, and when to stop.

Knowing when to stop is perhaps the most important skill in watercolor, as in governance. The temptation is always to add one more layer, to fix that slightly awkward passage, to smooth out the irregularities. But often these "imperfections" are what give the work life and breath.

## The Seventh Study

This is the seventh study in an ongoing series. Earlier versions explored different branches, different lighting conditions, different degrees of abstraction. Each taught me something new about both watercolor and observation. The series continues, following the seasons, learning what can only be learned through sustained attention to the particular.
