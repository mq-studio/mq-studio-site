The character embodies a philosophy central to both traditional Chinese thought and contemporary governance: that true harmony emerges not from uniformity but from the dynamic balance of different elements working together."

The character 和 (hé) is composed of two radicals: 禾 (grain/rice) on the left and 口 (mouth) on the right. Together they suggest the idea of having enough to eat, contentment, and by extension, harmony. This etymological richness makes it a powerful meditation subject.

## The Practice of Shufa

Chinese calligraphy, or shūfǎ (書法, literally "the way of writing"), is considered one of the highest art forms in Chinese culture. It's not merely decorative writing but a discipline that cultivates character, mindfulness, and spiritual development.

Each session begins with preparing the ink—grinding the solid ink stick against a stone with water, a meditative process that cannot be rushed. The quality of ink preparation directly affects the final work, teaching patience and attention to process over product.

## Semi-Cursive Script

I chose xingshu (semi-cursive script) for this piece because it occupies the middle ground between the formal regular script and the wild, expressive cursive script. This middle way resonates with the meaning of the character itself—harmony is neither rigid control nor chaotic freedom, but a dynamic balance between structure and flow.

The script allows for connected strokes that create a sense of momentum and energy while maintaining legibility. Each stroke influences the next, requiring the calligrapher to think several moves ahead while remaining fully present to the current stroke.

## Cultural Context

The concept of harmony (和) is central to Chinese philosophy, appearing prominently in Confucian thought where it describes the ideal state of social relations, and in Daoist philosophy where it represents alignment with the natural order.

In governance and planning, which forms the other part of my practice, this concept of harmony offers an alternative to Western emphases on consensus or compromise. Harmony doesn't require agreement or similarity; it requires that different elements find their proper relationship to the whole.

## Material Considerations

Xuan paper (rice paper) is remarkably sensitive. It responds instantly to variations in pressure, speed, ink saturation, and brush angle. There is no possibility of correction—each mark is permanent, each hesitation visible.

This unforgiving nature makes calligraphy an honest practice. You cannot fake confidence or competence. The paper reveals everything: your state of mind, your level of practice, your relationship to the moment.

## On Character

The Chinese word for calligraphy, shūfǎ, shares the character 法 (fǎ) with the word for law or method. This connection is not accidental. Both require internalization of rules so complete that spontaneity becomes possible. Both require discipline that enables freedom.

Years of practice are necessary before one's personality can truthfully emerge through the brush. Beginners reveal only their lack of skill; masters reveal their character.

## This Particular Execution

This version of 和 was created on a September morning after weeks of daily practice with the character. The weight shifts from a bold opening stroke to whisper-thin connections, then returns to strength in the final element. This variation in weight creates visual rhythm and expresses the dynamic quality of true harmony—not static balance but living equilibrium.

The character sits slightly off-center on the page, creating a tension with the empty space that activates the entire composition. In Chinese aesthetics, the empty space is as important as the brushwork—it's where the qi (vital energy) can circulate.
