This morning I ruined a painting. Or rather, I learned something important while attempting a painting that didn't work out as planned.

I was working on a coastal scene, laying in a pale wash for the sky. My attention wandered—I was mentally drafting an email about a governance committee meeting—and I didn't notice the puddle forming at the edge of my wash. By the time I returned fully to the painting, the puddle had dried with a hard edge, a dark line cutting across what should have been a smooth gradation.

## The Cost of Divided Attention

In watercolor, inattention has immediate, visible consequences. The medium doesn't wait for you to finish your mental multitasking. It dries at its own pace, flows according to gravity and paper texture, responds to ambient humidity—all whether you're paying attention or not.

This is, I realized, precisely the challenge in governance work. Policy implementation doesn't pause while we attend to other priorities. Communities continue to evolve, conditions change, unintended consequences emerge—all whether institutional attention is focused or distracted.

## Single-Tasking as Revolutionary Act

We live in a culture that celebrates multitasking, that rewards the ability to juggle multiple priorities simultaneously. But both watercolor and effective governance demand something different: the capacity for sustained, focused attention.

When I'm fully present with the painting—watching how the pigment flows, responding to what the water and paper are doing, making micro-adjustments in real-time—the work has a coherence and aliveness it lacks when I'm painting on autopilot.

Similarly, the most effective governance processes I've witnessed are those where participants are genuinely present, where attention isn't fragmented across devices and competing demands, where the quality of listening matches the complexity of the questions being addressed.

## Attention as Practice

The good news is that attention, like watercolor technique, can be practiced. It's a skill that strengthens with use.

My morning painting practice is partly about creating art, but it's equally about training attention. Each session is an opportunity to notice when my mind wanders, to gently return focus to the immediate reality of water, pigment, and paper.

This capacity for meta-attention—noticing that I've stopped noticing—transfers directly to my governance work. In meetings, I can recognize when discussion has become perfunctory, when we're going through motions rather than genuinely engaging. In policy development, I can sense when we're relying on familiar frameworks rather than responding to what the situation actually requires.

## The Ruined Painting

So what about this morning's failed painting? I could try to fix it—scrub out the hard edge, layer over it, cut the paper and reconfigure the composition. All of these are possible.

But sometimes the lesson is more valuable than the painting. I've set it aside to dry completely. Perhaps it will teach me something else tomorrow. Perhaps it will become the foundation for a different piece entirely. Perhaps it will simply serve as a reminder that attention matters.

## Implications for Leadership

If attention is the foundation of both art and effective governance, what does this mean for how we structure institutions and train leaders?

Perhaps we need to value deep focus over breadth of responsibility. Perhaps we need to create more space for sustained attention to complex problems rather than rapid cycling through agenda items. Perhaps we need to recognize that the quality of outcomes depends fundamentally on the quality of attention we bring to the process.

David just brought tea—his timing, as always, impeccable. He read the failed painting propped against the wall and simply said, "Sometimes the most interesting lessons come from what doesn't work."

He's right, of course. But I'm still going to pay better attention tomorrow.
