Ottawa trips don’t usually signal culinary extravaganzas.  On the referral of one of my Sauder colleagues, Tony Boardman, I signed up for a reservation at Atelier.  Made the reservation on-line (what a great invention) and then received a phone confirmation giving me instructions about how to find the restaurant due to the fact that there is no sign — just the address — 540 Rochester Street.

Tony had prepared me for the tasting menu which has a wine pairing that goes with it —  it sounds like it changes almost every night.  It was a Tuesday evening and the restaurant was quiet — but I got the sense that one always gets superb service at Atelier.

Of course they endeared themselves to me when the warm bread was presented with a tooth-paste-type-tube of butter.  Like this. Fun.

The first course was called **Bubbles** — it was a bit challenging for me because it had duck tongue (2 of them) but I really liked the balls of kohlrabi, little tapiocas, coconut bubbles and foam.  It was matched with a 2009 Hidden Bench Bistro Rose from Niagara.

The second course was **Prosciutto and Melon**.  Wonderful.  It was watermelon instead of the usual cantaloupe which I don’t really like.

The third course was called **Fennel Vision** — it was caramelized fennel, wilted spinach, edamane, powdered olives — and things that I can’t remember.  The chef does a lot of freeze drying and powdering of food — the tastes are really amazing.  This was matched with a Sauvignon Blanc (2010 Astrolabe) from Marlborough, New Zealand.

The fifth course was **46 degrees Salmon** with salmon, cucumber, dill, chervil (photo below).

By this time, I was wondering if I could stay the course.  But each individual offering was light and so tasty.  So I persevered.

**Liver Damage** was probably my least favourite — fois gras deep fried with parsnip pieces, brioche and pistashio nuts matched with a NV Cossart Gordon Medium Rich 5-year Bual Madeira from Portugal.  **Busy Beets** followed with frozen extruded beets, beets and a little slide of brie accompanied by a 2006 Dr. Hermann Urziger Wurzgarten Riesling Spatlese from Mosel Germany.  And then there was a delicious **Duck Tortelloni** with smoked mushrooms, what I wrote down as “amazing sauce”, hazelnuts and I think a quince paste.  This was accompanied by a 2007 Beresford Shiraz from McLaren Vale, Australia.  And the final savoury was **Elk** (a first time for me) — a steak which was delicately broiled and very tasty — especially with the 2006 A to Z Winewords Chemin de Terre from Oregon.

While I had requested a half-portion of each of the accompanying pairings, I was reaching my limit.  And now dessert of which there were three!  **Pomme de Mars** was apple rings with Ice Cream cake and a walnut crumble paired with a 2008nDomaine Pinnacle Ice Cider from the Eastern Townships.  **iCup** was a frozen passionfruit pure inside of which was a chocolate cake on a cookie.  Hmmm.  The match here was a 2007 De Bortoli Noble One Botrytis Semillon from New South Wales.  Just when I really thought I was done, **The Troll Truffle** arrived.  I’ll let you imagine what that was.

The design of everything was exquisite — the plating, the incredible tastes — it really awakens your taste buds and reminds you what food can taste like at the hands of a great chef.  I didn’t meet the chef — but I did see the kitchen where all this happens.  It is compact and, of course, well designed.

You can find **Atelier** at 540 Rochester Street Ottawa Ontario — 613-321-3537, info@atelierrestaurant.ca.  And apologies to Atelier if I made any mistakes in listing the ingredients — they were too many and too wonderful to remember/list.
