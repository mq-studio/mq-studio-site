Great leaders aspire to manage “by design” – with a sense of purpose and foresight. But too few leaders incorporate the proven practices and principles of the design disciplines. That should change with _Designed Leadership._ Here, strategic-design scholar and urban systems designer Moura Quayle presents a clear and accessible handbook for understanding and incorporating design lessons and processes into leadership applications. For example, every designer knows that failure – essential to innovation – is catastrophic in implementation; it’s why designers created studios in which to test ideas. It’s expressed in the indispensable concept of **ASK. TRY. DO.** Designers also know how to learn from natural systems. They know it is vital to make values explicit. From artists to architects, engineers to inventors, design practitioners know that strategic design loosens the mind and activates innovation. For managers at any level, _Designed Leadership_ uses original visuals and field-tested examples to illuminate the kind of thinking, theorizing, and practice that results in long-lasting high performance in the workplace and beyond.
