At the Jasper Innovation Forum, our last task in small groups was to develop SMART objectives and place those objectives in an Impact Achievability Matrix.

**S**pecific.

**M**easurable.

**A**greed upon/Actionable.

**R**ealistic.

**T**imely.

So we went into groups and a) did a gap analysis between present and future states; b) translated the gaps into SMART objectives; and, c) Assessed the SMART objectives for impact and achievability.  Out of this process came a number of “post-it notes” complete with objectives.  I didn’t get these noted down – so will follow-up when the info is available from the Alberta Research Council.

Annette Trimbee, Alberta Deputy Minister for Advanced Education and Research/Technology was our guest lunch speaker.   She brought us up-to-date on the changes that are occurring within the Alberta Government around how they organize the research and innovation space.  They are creating Alberta Innovates – with 3 entities:  Energy and Environmental Solutions;  Health Solutions; and Bio-Solutions.  They are also creating the Alberta Research & Innovation Authority (ARIA).  So lots of changes there.    Alberta has also created a Premiers’ Council for Economic Strategy – chaired by David Emerson – so some opportunities here for partnerships with BC given that Emerson chairs our Economic Council too.

Finally we had a session on possible demonstration projects for new and transitional next generation communities.  John MacDougall, the CEO of the Alberta Research Council suggested the possibility of 4 different Alberta communities for demonstration project – communities of different size and diverse economic bases.   A number of other ideas were discussed.

I actually wondered about tackling Jasper Park Lodge itself – a small community but one that could really use some attention at the level of sustainable systems and general visitor experience.

Will report back with a link when more info is available on the second Jasper Innovation Forum.  As usual for me, I learned a lot.  But also realize that I am pretty well at my max for inputting new info into my personal hard drive.  Need some digestion time.
