Yesterday at the Gaining Ground/Resilient Cities conference Mayor Gregor Robertson welcomed over 750 participants and took the opportunity to give them a sneak peek at **_Vancouver 2020:  A Bright Green Future_, the 10-year plan which is the result of almost a year’s work by the Mayor’s Greenest City Action Team (GCAT).  The report includes 10 goals with specific targets for 2020.  The high level list is:**

**1\.  Green Economy Capital**

**2\.  Climate Leadership**

**3\.  Green Buildings**

**4\.  Green Mobility**

**5\.  Zero WAste**

6\.  Easy Access to Nature

7\.  Lighter Footprint

8\.  Clean Water

9\.  Clean Air

10\.  Local Food.

I am particularly interested in the GCAT process — and that is what we’ll be discussing this afternoon at the Gaining Ground/Resilient Cities conference.  We are doing a workshop on GCAT — the “we” is Gord Price (SFU City Program and former City Councillor); Rob Safrata (CEO of Novex Couriers); Melina Scholefield (Director of Sustainability at City of Vancouver).  We’ll be reflecting on the process and what opportunities and challenges _A Bright Green Future_ presents for us.

This is a very busy week — yesterday alone I attended parts of Gaining Ground (including a workshop on The Bold New Economy (future blog), the BC Business Council’s Chapter 3 of the Outlook 2020 series (future blog), the celebratory Board of Trade lunch for the CEO of the Canada Line, Jane Bird, and a reception hosted jointly by the UBC Centre for Sustainability and Social Innovation and the University of Oregon’s Centre for Sustainable Business Practice — both of these centres are located in their respective business schools.  This week we are also hosting a delegation from Portland led by Mayor Sam Adams.  Yesterday we set up a session to share some of UBC’s sustainability initiatives (future blog).

And today promises to be equally busy.  To find the full GCAT report — here is the link:
