Practivism II – Human Centred Design.  Kara Pecknold’s topic was the  _IDEO Human-Centred Design Toolkit._ Kara has a degree in English literature, she taught business communications in Eastern Europe and led educational teams in Thailand.  She then got an MAA in design at Emily Carr where she focused her research on cross-cultural design process.

Her narrative about Ruwanda and the water hyacynths was inspiring.  My notes are a bit sparse (must have been getting late) but the essence of the project was to utilize the water hyacinth (invasive species) to make a variety of woven baskets for sale.   Kara engaged the community in the human-centred design process, assisting them in developing the idea, the marketing and the implementation.  Very much a community participation and education process.
