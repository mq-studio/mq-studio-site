London — what a rich cultural and physical landscape.  I keep pouring over the map wondering who has ever walked all this maze of roads, streets, places, mews, lanes, malls and avenues.  I made a bit of a start focused on the neighbourhood where I was staying in Belgravia but on to a couple of London vignettes….

**A kilted porter**

As part of the UK 4-day adventure Dave suggested I stay at one of the clubs associated with the Vancouver Club.  **The Caledonian Club** is on Halkin Street, just off Grosvenor Place.  The Hyde Park Corner station is the closest tube location.  The Club is billed as “a little bit of Scotland in Belgravia” — and so it is.  Martin, complete with kilt and really strong Scottish brogue, met me at the door.  I was jet-lagged but did manage to comprehend that there were two rooms on the first floor that I couldn’t enter — no women allowed.   They did relax that rule in the evenings when after 6pm (on Fridays at least) women are allowed into the bar.

**Kim Wilkie — landscape architect for London landmarks**

My first night in London I was desperately trying to stay awake to get into the time zone rhythm.  My Berkeley class-mate Kim Wilkie came to the rescue by inviting me for dinner in Richmond — which is turns out is a lovely little town at the end of one of the tube lines in west London.  He can walk to the tube station from his house which accommodates a flat above his office.   He has been responsible for key landscape renewals in London — the Thames Landscape Strategy from Hampton to Kew, the City of London Cemetery, Hyde Park Corner (current project)– as well as several large scale projects in Moscow.

**Harrods in the ‘hood**

With the business reason for my trip to London behind me (The Redesigning Business Summit: The Big Rethink — see my design blog [http://design.blogs.sauder.ubc.ca/](http://design.blogs.sauder.ubc.ca/ "Design Blog") for the serious stuff.)

I had today — a Saturday — to myself in London.  Because Dave and I are returning quite soon for a two-month stay I wanted to leave the Tate Modern, the British Museum and so on for us to do together.   Scanning the map, I noticed that I was in easy walking distance of Harrods.  Every good cultural landscape detective looks into what the locals are up to — at the least the Belgravia locals.  I did a small amount of damage and had lunch at the Veuve Cliquot champagne bar (see above).

**39 Steps**

Was wondering what to do for entertainment that would be something Dave wouldn’t want to do.  I came upon the play **39 Steps** — based on the mystery by John Buchan which happened to be a favourite of my dad.  A ticket was easily bought and I was off to the Criterion Theatre for the 4pm show.  I was sure it would be populated by a sprinkling of people — partly due to the time of day — but also due to the fact that it has been running since October 2006!  But it was packed.  A very clever  and well-designed production with only 4 actors and a multitude of characters.  It felt good to be in live theatre in Piccadilly Circus.

Home tomorrow.  Also good.
