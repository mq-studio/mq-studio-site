Food is a archetypal need.  So one of the first orders of business in a new city is finding out where to eat and where to buy food.  Despite the current wet, wet, wet weather, we are enjoying exploring our neighbourhood for its food offerings.

I knew about the Ferry Building — right on the Embarcadero (where the freeway was pulled down) and renovated into mainly food shops and restaurants.

There is a busy farmers market outside on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. [http://www.ferrybuildingmarketplace.com/](http://www.ferrybuildingmarketplace.com/ "Ferry Building Market Place") From the web site:  _The Ferry Plaza Farmers Market is a California certified farmers market operated by the Center for Urban Education about Sustainable Agriculture (CUESA)._

This shows the interior space — really an urban street — quite beautiful in various types of light.  Certainly supporting the 100 mile diet and local food producers — but at a price.

And here is an exterior shot — we did experience some sun last week so we know that it CAN look like this.

__Thinking that we probably shouldn’t be calling the Ferry Building shops our mainstay food shopping place, we tried out some other options.  There is a Safeway  a few blocks from the apartment — but it was really not a great experience and food quality was so-so. Won’t go back there, partly because the route there just isn’t that spatially interesting.__

__Which brings me to the point — the **path** is important to us.  How we get to where we are going is a critical part of the experience.__

__For example, to get to the Ferry Building from our place we have a choice of different paths — we can stroll down Clay Street on the side of the Embarcadero Centre shops or we have 3 possible routes through the Embarcadero complex itself — which is a 70s urban design effort (started in 1968 and ended in 1983) that still seems to work very well from a path experience sense (although one can see retail disappearing and medical offices on the increase).__

There are various levels to explore and in this heavy rain it is a real advantage to be able to wend one’s way through beautiful spaces to the destination — food.  Or we can walk down Sacramento or California past restaurants we have yet to try out.

Next blog — the path to Whole Foods.
