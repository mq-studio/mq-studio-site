“Snooker faces the grim reaper” is the headline in Sunday’s Wall Street Journal.  Not in our family.  Not since we started learning to play at the full-size Vancouver Club tables and since we have been in London we have discovered late night snooker on the telly (jet lag).

The Journal is suggesting that:

_“Snooker’s popularity was never really about the game itself, it was the sport’s superstars and their tempestuous rivalries that captivate audiences.”_

What has been fun and fascinating is to follow the “come-back” of Steve Davis — 6-time world champion who is no in the semi-finals.

How can you not enjoy watching someone play snooker with such great expressions?

Dave at the Van Club snooker table -- the next Steve Davis???

And it was also reassuring that the “pros” sometimes miss some dead-easy (ha) shots.

So we are now inspired to find some empty snooker tables around London so we can hone our skills (and trying not to scratch — ie missing every ball on the table).  After all it is good “after dinner” exercise.
