This morning, while preparing for a governance seminar, I found myself reaching for my watercolors. Not as procrastination, but as preparation. There's something about the fluidity of paint on paper that mirrors the fluidity of policy in practice—both require a balance of intention and adaptation, structure and spontaneity.

## The Academic Artist's Dilemma

For years, well-meaning colleagues have suggested I "focus." Choose a lane. Be either the serious governance scholar or the practicing artist. But this advice misunderstands something fundamental about how knowledge works, how creativity functions, and how innovation emerges.

When I paint, I'm not taking a break from thinking about governance—I'm thinking about governance differently. The way watercolor bleeds across boundaries on wet paper teaches me about the porosity of institutional borders. The discipline required to achieve transparency in layered washes mirrors the patience needed for consensus-building in policy work.

## Design as a Bridge

Design thinking has become my bridge between these supposedly separate worlds. It's a methodology that academia has finally begun to embrace, but artists have always known: the best solutions emerge from a dance between constraint and possibility, between the analytical and the intuitive.

In my landscape architecture work, this integration is perhaps most visible. A park isn't just green space—it's governance made tangible, community values expressed in pathways and plantings, democracy practiced through shared spaces.

## The Studio as Laboratory

My studio has become a laboratory for this integration. Here, policy papers dry alongside watercolor studies. Sketches for public consultations share wall space with calligraphy practice. This isn't confusion—it's convergence.

David often reminds me that the word "theory" comes from the Greek "theoria," meaning "contemplation" or "looking at." Art is simply another way of looking, another mode of theorizing about the world.

## Moving Forward

As I prepare to launch this digital studio—this attempt to create a space where all these practices can coexist publicly—I'm reminded that the real innovation isn't in choosing between identities but in refusing to choose.

The future belongs to those who can think systemically while feeling deeply, who can analyze rigorously while imagining boldly. In other words, the future belongs to those who understand that thinking, feeling, and doing are not separate activities but different facets of a single practice: being fully human in a complex world.

Perhaps that's what this studio is really about—not showcasing work, but demonstrating a way of working that refuses the false boundaries we've been taught to accept.
