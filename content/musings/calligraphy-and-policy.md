There's a surprising overlap between the discipline of calligraphy and the craft of policy writing. Both require clarity, precision, and knowing when to follow the rules and when to break them.

## The Discipline of Form

Calligraphy is fundamentally about constraints. Letter forms follow centuries of evolution. Stroke order matters. The angle of the pen, the pressure applied, the rhythm of execution—all of these are governed by tradition and technique.

Policy writing has similar constraints: legal precedent, bureaucratic conventions, the formal structures of legislative language. These aren't arbitrary rules; they're patterns that have emerged over time to serve specific purposes.

## When to Break the Rules

But here's what both practices teach: you can only break the rules effectively if you first master them.

In calligraphy, the most expressive work comes from artists who have spent years learning traditional forms. They know which rules exist for technical reasons (the physical properties of ink and paper) and which exist simply as convention. This knowledge lets them innovate purposefully rather than randomly.

The same is true for policy. The most effective policy innovations I've seen come from people who deeply understand existing frameworks. They know where the flexibility lives, which precedents can be challenged, and how to craft language that's both legally sound and genuinely progressive.

## The Practice of Presence

Both calligraphy and policy writing demand a particular kind of attention. You can't be somewhere else while you're doing either.

When I'm working with ink, there's no "undo" button. Each stroke is permanent. This creates a quality of presence—I have to be completely committed to each mark as I make it, while simultaneously holding awareness of the whole composition.

Policy work should have this same quality. Each clause, each definition, each requirement connects to everything else. Change one element, and the entire structure shifts. Yet we often rush through policy drafting as if it were just bureaucratic paperwork rather than the careful composition it should be.

## Revision and Refinement

Interestingly, both practices also require knowing when to stop.

In calligraphy, there's a moment when additional work begins to diminish rather than enhance. The piece has found its form. More intervention would be overworking it.

Policy goes through necessary revision cycles, but there's also a point of diminishing returns. Over-refining can strip out the very clarity and boldness that made a policy proposal effective in the first place.

## A Daily Practice

I try to do some calligraphy most mornings before turning to policy work. It's not just about maintaining the skill; it's about cultivating the mindset. The patience, precision, and presence required for good calligraphy inform how I approach all my other work.

Maybe that's the deepest connection: both are practices, not products. The goal isn't to have written a policy or completed a piece of calligraphy. The goal is to become someone who can do that work with skill, care, and attention.

## What's Your Practice?

I'm curious about what practices inform your professional work. Do you find connections between seemingly unrelated skills? How do your hobbies or creative pursuits shape your approach to "serious" work?
