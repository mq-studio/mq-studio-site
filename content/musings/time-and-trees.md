excerpt: "Planting trees forces us to think beyond our own lifespans. What if we brought that same temporal humility to all our planning and governance work?"

Yesterday I participated in a community tree-planting event. Fifty volunteers, eighty trees, a February day threatening rain. As I tamped soil around a young cedar, I did the math: this tree, if it survives, will reach maturity in about 80 years. I will almost certainly be dead.

This is not a morbid thought. It's a liberating one.

## The Tyranny of the Short Term

Most governance work operates on ridiculously compressed timelines. Political terms of 4 years. Strategic plans of 5-10 years. In the corporate world, quarterly reports rule decision-making. We optimize for the immediately measurable and call it rational.

But trees don't work on these timelines. Neither do watersheds, or soil formation, or cultural change, or the consequences of today's carbon emissions.

Indigenous planning traditions speak of seven generations—decisions made with consideration for their impact 150+ years into the future. When I first encountered this concept in partnership work with First Nations communities, I was struck by how foreign it felt, how difficult to operationalize within contemporary planning frameworks.

But it's not foreign when you're planting trees.

## What Trees Teach

Every landscape architect is, by necessity, a time traveler. We design parks that will be used by children not yet born. We plant trees that will provide shade for grandchildren we'll never meet. We build infrastructure meant to last beyond our lifetimes.

This forces a particular kind of humility. You can't know exactly how your design will perform across decades. You can't predict all the uses it will accommodate, all the ways communities will adapt it to their needs.

The best you can do is design for resilience, for adaptability, for graceful aging. You design with an acceptance that you're not creating something perfect for all time, but rather something good enough to evolve with changing needs.

## Implications for Governance

What if we brought this arboreal timescale to policy-making?

Not every decision requires multi-generational thinking—we still need to fix potholes and balance budgets. But the big questions—climate adaptation, infrastructure investment, education system design, reconciliation with Indigenous peoples—these demand thinking that extends beyond electoral cycles and quarterly reports.

This means:
- Building in feedback mechanisms that allow for course correction over decades
- Designing policies that can evolve rather than requiring complete overhaul
- Measuring success not just by immediate outcomes but by trajectories
- Accepting that we're planting seeds for futures we won't inhabit

## The Paradox of Legacy

Here's what I find fascinating: the tree-planters most worried about "legacy" often create the least enduring work. They want monuments, things that carry their name, recognition that they've made a permanent mark.

But trees don't care about who planted them. The cedar I planted yesterday won't remember my name. It will simply grow, or not, depending on soil conditions, water availability, competition from other plants, and a thousand factors beyond anyone's control.

The landscape architects I most admire design spaces that become so integrated into community life that people forget they were designed at all. They create conditions for emergence rather than monuments to their own vision.

## Learning from Failure

Here's an uncomfortable truth: many of the trees I've planted over my career have died. Poor site selection. Inadequate maintenance. Drought. Disease. Changed conditions.

This is the cost of long-term thinking—you don't get to know which of your efforts will survive. You plant anyway, because some will thrive, and their thriving matters more than your knowing about it.

Policy-making rarely acknowledges this reality. We want guaranteed outcomes, measurable impacts, clear lines between action and result. But complex systems don't work that way. Sometimes you plant seeds that take decades to germinate. Sometimes they never do. Sometimes they grow into something completely unexpected.

## Time Sovereignty

Indigenous scholars speak of "time sovereignty"—the right to operate on timelines aligned with natural and cultural cycles rather than imposed administrative calendars.

Planting trees is an act of time sovereignty. It's saying: this matters regardless of fiscal years or political terms. This is valuable even though I won't see the result. This is worthwhile because time extends beyond my individual lifespan.

What if we designed governance systems with that same temporal sovereignty? What if we had mechanisms that couldn't be overturned by a single election, that required building on predecessor's work rather than starting from zero each term?

## The Rain Begins

The rain that was threatening finally arrives. The volunteers cheer—our newly planted trees get their first watering from the sky rather than our buckets. Someone's brought thermoses of hot chocolate. Children play around the trees they've just planted, trees that will outlive them.

This is what hope looks like: planting something you won't see mature, caring for a future you won't inhabit, making the world slightly better for people you'll never meet.

Maybe that's what all meaningful work requires—a kind of faith in time larger than our own small moment.
