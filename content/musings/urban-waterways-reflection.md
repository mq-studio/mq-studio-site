## About This Video

In this short reflection, I share some thoughts while walking along False Creek in Vancouver. Urban waterways have always fascinated meâ€”they're simultaneously natural systems and human interventions, constantly negotiating the boundary between wilderness and design.

## Key Themes

The video touches on:

- How water creates unexpected connections in dense urban environments
- The tension between controlling water and working with its nature
- What Indigenous stewardship practices can teach us about urban water management
- The emotional dimension of water in cities

## The Sketch Connection

After recording this, I did a quick watercolor sketch trying to capture the morning light on the water. There's something about the way watercolor pigment flows and pools that mirrors actual water movement. The medium itself teaches us about flow, resistance, and the beauty of relinquishing control.

## Further Reading

If this resonates, you might enjoy my 2018 paper "Riparian Rights and Urban Wrongs: Reimagining Water Governance in Coastal Cities" (link in publications section).

## Your Thoughts?

What's your relationship with water in your city? Do you live near it, avoid it, seek it out? I'm curious how others experience these urban-natural interfaces.
