I've been thinking about how the best design interventions create conditions for emergence rather than prescribing outcomes. What happens when we design for possibility instead of certainty?

## The Problem with Prescription

Traditional urban design often operates from a control mindset. We draw precise plans, specify exact materials, predetermine how spaces will be used. But cities don't work that way. The most vibrant urban spaces are those that adapted, evolved, and surprised their designers.

Last week, I revisited a public plaza I helped design fifteen years ago in Vancouver. The design team had imagined it as a quiet contemplative space. Instead, it became the city's most popular spot for impromptu performances, flash mobs, and political gatherings. The "failure" to match our original vision was actually its greatest success.

## Creating Conditions, Not Conclusions

What if we approached design differently? Instead of asking "What should this space be?" we could ask "What conditions would allow this space to become what it needs to be?"

This shift requires:

- **Flexibility over permanence**: Design elements that can be moved, adapted, repurposed
- **Incompleteness over totality**: Leave deliberate gaps for community input and evolution
- **Observation over assumption**: Watch how spaces are actually used before finalizing interventions
- **Permission over restriction**: Default to allowing diverse uses unless there's a compelling reason not to

## The Watercolor Parallel

This thinking connects directly to my painting practice. The best watercolors happen when I set up initial conditions—the right wetness of paper, the concentration of pigment, the angle of the surface—and then let physics and chemistry take over.

I can guide, suggest, influence. But the moment I try to control too much, the painting dies. The magic happens in the space between intention and emergence.

## A Question for Governance

If this principle works in design and art, what about governance? Can we create policy frameworks that set conditions for emergence rather than prescribing outcomes?

I'm thinking of participatory budgeting processes, adaptive management in environmental policy, and community land trusts. These are all examples of governance structures that establish parameters while leaving space for communities to self-organize.

## An Invitation

I'm exploring these ideas in my upcoming research on "Governance for the Unexpected." If you've seen examples of design or policy that successfully balances structure with emergence, I'd love to hear about them.

What systems have you seen that were designed to evolve?
