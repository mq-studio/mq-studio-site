## 🏗️ IDP GOVERNANCE COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

### Core Operating Principles (MANDATORY)
- **OSAA Directive**: One Single Atomized Action - every action must be discrete, specific, and independently verifiable
- **Security First**: All operations must maintain security posture and follow hardened protocols
- **Human-in-the-loop Validation**: Explicit outcome verification required
- **Optimize for Ultimate Objective**: Focus on end-user productivity gains

### File Management Principles (REQUIRED)
- ✅ Avoid creating "clutter" - use existing structure
- ✅ Update/replace rather than create new when possible
- ✅ Review existing assets before creating new files
- ✅ Track all changes with meaningful commit messages
- ✅ Remove unnecessary code/files during implementation

### Agent Awareness Protocol (MANDATORY)
Before any filesystem operations:
1. **Query Inventory Context**: Check existing project structure and dependencies
2. **Analyze Impact**: Assess risks to existing systems (Low/Medium/High)
3. **Check Dependencies**: Verify compatibility with IDP infrastructure
4. **Proceed with Verification**: Execute with appropriate validation level

```bash
# Execute the enhanced installation script
cd /home/ichardart/code/voice-assistant-optimized
./scripts/enhanced_install.sh
```

**Required Validations During Installation:**
- ✅ System dependencies check (Python 3.8+, audio system, memory analysis)
- ✅ Virtual environment creation and activation
- ✅ Dependency installation with version verification
- ✅ Whisper model download and caching
- ✅ Configuration file creation with security compliance
- ✅ Basic functionality testing

### Phase 3: Integration Testing
```bash
# Execute comprehensive test suite
python tests/enhanced_test_suite.py
```

**Required Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Audio processing (silence, noise, speech-like content)
- ✅ Edge cases (empty audio, very short/long clips, corrupted data)
- ✅ Error scenarios (network failures, memory pressure, disk space)
- ✅ Performance benchmarks (latency, memory usage, concurrent processing)
- ✅ Cloud provider resilience (retry logic, fallback mechanisms)

### Phase 4: Browser Integration Setup
```bash
# Install native messaging for browser extension
./scripts/install_native_messaging.sh
```

**Integration Requirements:**
- ✅ Chrome/Chromium native messaging host installation
- ✅ Browser extension loading instructions
- ✅ AI platform compatibility verification (Claude, Gemini, Perplexity)

### Phase 5: Production Validation
1. **Functional Testing**: Verify voice-to-text works across all target applications
2. **Performance Validation**: Confirm <3 second latency for 10-second clips
3. **Error Recovery Testing**: Validate 95% success rate with retry mechanisms
4. **Security Verification**: Confirm no API keys in logs or config files
