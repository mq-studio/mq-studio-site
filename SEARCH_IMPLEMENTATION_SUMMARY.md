- "calligraphy" - Returns artworks
- "policy" - Returns publications

## Usage

### Basic SearchBar
```tsx
import SearchBar from '@/components/search/SearchBar';

<SearchBar />
```

### Custom Configuration
```tsx
<SearchBar
  placeholder="Search MQ Studio..."
  autoFocus={true}
  showButton={false}
/>
```

### Direct Search Link
```html
<a href="/search?q=governance">Search for governance</a>
```

## Next Steps

To fully test the implementation:

1. **Start Development Server:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/ichardart/code/clients/moura_quayle/website-mq-studio
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Search Functionality:**
   - Visit http://localhost:3000
   - Try searching from the homepage
   - Test keyboard navigation
   - Visit /search directly
   - Try various search queries

3. **Verify Features:**
   - Debouncing works (wait 300ms after typing)
   - Suggestions appear and are clickable
   - Search results page shows grouped results
   - Highlighting works on search terms
   - All links navigate correctly

## Known Considerations

1. **Dependencies:** The build currently fails due to missing `react-markdown` dependency in other parts of the project (unrelated to search)
2. **Content Loading:** Content is loaded from markdown files in `/content/` directories
3. **Search Performance:** Current implementation uses in-memory search; consider Elasticsearch or Algolia for production
4. **Caching:** No caching implemented yet; consider adding for better performance

## Future Enhancements

See `/components/search/README.md` for detailed list of potential improvements:
- Advanced filters (type, category, date, tags)
- Faceted search
- Search history
- Voice search
- Full-text search integration
- Search analytics
- Infinite scroll
- Server-side caching

## Support

For questions or issues:
1. Review `/components/search/README.md`
2. Check API endpoint: `/api/content?search=test`
3. Verify content files exist in `/content/` directories
4. Check browser console for errors
